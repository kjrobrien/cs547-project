It's for a portable game console that you operate using Spirit Power!\nAt the time I thought, wow, she must be really bored...and maybe she was.\nBut when I turned it on, a wondrous scene unfolded before my eyes.\nI remember thinking, wow, that's a lot of bubbles popping around.\nAnd then she was like, \"Ah-hah! Bubbles!\" She seemed to understand what was going on.\nAt the time, I went through the motions, or just watched Marisa play.\nBut I didn't really think much of it other than, \"Well, this is weird.\"\nHowever, in time, once this game really took off in Gensokyo, I came to realiaze it's a major breakthrough in gameplay.\nEven in a peaceful place like this. I sometimes feel like I'm in a feverish delirium, seeing things like storms that aren't really there.\nEven with a particular omen, you have to strain your eyes hard to see it. Sometimes it's nothing more than a little ripple in the air.\nLooking back now, it wasn't really signs of a major upheaval...\nIn a way, it might have just been a little calm before the \"storm\" that Gensokyo hasn't seen before... Or something like that.",

Developed by WayForward and published physically by Limited Run Games, this Switch-exclusive one- or two-player action title will deliver thrills, laughs, and varied gameplay unlike anything else on the system.\n\nIn Vitamin Connection, players assume the roles of Vita-Boy and Mina-Girl and take control of the minuscule Capsule Ship to battle evil bacteria from within living organisms. By blasting subatomic foes with your Vitamin Beam, utilizing a special claw tool, and navigating maze-like stages, you\u2019ll save the members of the Sable family \u2014 including the dog! \u2014 from a variety of hazardous and increasingly wacky predicaments. Each level also includes sub-games featuring rhythm challenges, Pong-like reflex tests, and more.\n\nWhile the entire game can be played solo, Vitamin Connection also features an innovative, asymmetrical local two-player co-op mode, in which one player controls the Capsule Ship\u2019s movement and shooting, while the other handles the ship\u2019s rotation and aiming. Coordination and a connection between players are essential for success!",

Tifalia forces to join as an assistant and producer after hearing \"What is lacking in the current Circus is mediocre like you!\"\n\nShe was worried all night wondering how she going on a journey, but with her family's words, she decided to participate.\n\nA crazy dragon that loves to tickle, a spikey clown that doesn't make you laugh, a water creature who doesn't want to use water magic, an acrobat who doesn't know how to entertain, a drunkard furball, an unmotivated leader, and an amateur producer who just joined.\n\nWill they be able to perform successfully in front of crowds?",
    "summary": "Tifalia's comfortable life is turned upside down when a dragon crash-lands right into her! This triggers her first encounter with CIRCUS, a performance troupe that travels around the world to save their crown prince. After a dismal failure of a performance, CIRCUS discovers that Tifalia might be able to help them and recruit her to act as producer for their dysfunctional troupe.\n\nWill they master the ring? Or just be mediocre?\n\nA crazy dragon who's more silly than scary, a prickly clown who won't make you laugh, a mysterious conductor who doesn't want to use water magic, an acrobat who doesn't know how to entertain, a drunkard fur ball, an unmotivated leader, and an amateur producer who just joined.\n\nCan you help this dysfunctional troupe create their greatest performance?",

Buried within the treacherous Frozen Dungeons scattered across the Kingdom, these relics once sealed away a nightmare so great that elders still tremble at the mere whisper of his name.\n\nNazar, the Frozen Wraith, has risen from his induced slumber, ice cracking beneath his cursed steps. With each breath, winter tightens its grip on the land, and his hunger for destruction grows ever more insatiable. His goal is clear: to shroud the world in eternal frost, turning all living things into monuments of frozen despair.\n\nHatch, the Kingdom calls upon you. The Ember Sprites, with their fiery magic, hold the key to unlocking the Frozen Dungeons. With their help, you can reclaim the lost Artifacts and restore the balance that once held Nazar captive. Only when these relics are united will you be able to breach the heart of Nazar\u2019s Frozen Fortress and challenge him in his lair.\n\nBut haste is of the essence. Already, Nazar\u2019s poison affects the Kingdom, ensnaring villages and souls alike in his icy prisons. The road ahead is fraught with peril \u2014 traps, monsters, and dark magic wait to test your resolve at every turn. Yet, the fate of Talonreach rests on your shoulders, and there is no one else who can carry this burden.\n\nThe light is fading, but hope endures if you rise to the challenge. Will you stand against the encroaching darkness, or allow Nazar\u2019s frost to consume all? The Kingdom\u2019s last breath rests in your hands.",

In this time of need, Cadence is mysteriously transported to Hyrule by the Triforce and manages to wake up Link and Zelda. While Cadence goes off to try to find a way home, Link and Zelda travel across Hyrule to find and defeat Octavo's four champions, who each possess enchanted instruments containing musical power. After Link and Zelda, soon rejoined by Cadence, obtain the instruments and enter Hyrule Castle, Octavo reveals that he and his champions were meant to be used to battle against Ganon, who will take over Hyrule in the future. Finding himself defeated, Octavo opens a portal into the future, where Link, Zelda, and Cadence confront Ganon and combine their forces to defeat him. With help from the Golden Lute, Link and Zelda use the power of the Triforce to try and send Cadence back to her own world.",

Guided by this new ally, Link sets out in an adventure to protect Hyrule, find Princess Zelda and uncover the mysteries of the Zonai.",

He notices small puddles of black goop on the path and follows them, eventually stopping at a mass of black graffiti shaped like Shadow Mario's logo from Super Mario Sunshine. The graffiti expands to create a portal that Mario falls through, transporting him to Lake Lapcat, where a rainstorm is occurring.\n\nShortly after Mario lands, he encounters Bowser, who has become a larger and more powerful form known as Fury Bowser. Mario finds a Cat Shine in the surrounding area, which clears the goop off of a nearby lighthouse. Fury Bowser is blinded by the beam of light that shines from the lighthouse, and retreats into the Fury Sun in the middle of Lake Lapcat. Immediately afterward, several islands emerge from the water.\nAfter Fury Bowser retreats, the storm clears and Mario finds a panicking Bowser Jr., who explains why Bowser transformed. He shows Mario a picture he painted of his father and paints it black with his Magic Paintbrush, showing that Bowser Jr. was the one who corrupted Bowser. He realizes that both he and his father are in trouble, reluctantly asking Mario to help him, but clarifying this would not happen under normal circumstances. Mario agrees to do so, with Bowser Jr. joining him for the rest of the adventure.",

The game includes a number of events, including returning ones from previous Mario & Sonic titles, such as boxing, soccer, swimming, and gymnastics, and new ones, such as karate, skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing. It will also feature a mode with 2D Events where players can compete in classic 2D versions of events from the 1964 Summer Olympics. Based off older sports games, these events are played using button controls only and will only feature eight playable characters. These 2D Events' animations reflect the 8-bit Mario and 16-bit Sonic game art style.",
