          "content": "PW3 is a game in the Warriors series by Koei Tecmo. If you know how one plays, you know the basics of all of them. But for the uninformed, I'll summarize. Warriors games put you in control of a character in the middle of a battlefield. your goal is to execute tactics in the flashiest way possible, taking on hordes of enemies at once. your KO count can easily reach over 2k. the more KOs you get, the more your special gauge increases. When the gauge is full, you can unleash a devastating special attack, which can easily KO hundreds at a time. Unique to this installment is the Special Kizuna attack. the more damage you deal with a certain character at your side, the higher your Kizuna gauge will go for that character. When full, activating it will put you in a special state where every KO is replaced with a ! KO, which are counted separately from normal KOs. Once active, a clock starts ticking, and before it runs out, pressing A will unleash a devastating Kizuna attack, which can have up to 4 other combatants joining you in an all out assault!\r\n\r\nWarriors games are always the ultimate power fantasy and Pirate Warriors 3 is no different. Each of the game's 22 levels span anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour, and usually end with fighting a powerful boss character. The levels stay relatively faithful to the source (we'll get to it,) and with 22, there's quite a lot of playtime packed in. \r\n\r\nAlong with the main game, called the Legend Log, and free play mode, called the Free Log, there's also the Dream Log. The Dream Log contains a series of randomly generated challenges scaling in level across around 100 Islands. Each level has random factions, bosses, layout, and goals. As a result, they can all feel same-y and get repetitive fast. Along with these challenges, you can fight Boss enemies on these Islands and unlock them for the Free Log. These two modes exist in tension. It's clear that the developers want you to explore the Dream Log in tandem with the Legend Log, as the early Dream Log islands are so low level, but you level up so fast that it makes the Legend Log a joke. Even on Hard mode for the whole game, I didn't fail a single Legend log level once, and only failed a Dream log encounter once. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Graphics are ok, but nothing special. They do the 2D manga characters in 3D style better than most of the JoJo games (but that's a story for another time). The lip sync is awful, and the very obvious use of mocap certainly doesn't do the game any favours. The graphical quality in the levels themselves are really good, nothing special for 2015, but I say It still holds up. The Music is fine, but again nothing special. The graphical and musical quality is the definition of middle of the road. The main theme is memorable, but the other songs only serve to make the game not silent, nothing more. The only reason I critique so hard is because they could have been more. The designs are taken from the anime, and Toei's logo is all over this thing, so why they didn't license the anime's phenomenal OST is beyond me.\r\n\r\nThe cast of PW3 is....alright. not perfect but alright. Of course all 9 of the straw-hats and Jinbei are playable, but the rest of the choices can be strange. you'd expect Vivi and Belamy to be playable, but neither are. characters with full move sets and models are in the game, but never unlockable (which is a main gripe with most of the warriors games I've played). Don Krieg, Arlong, Bonclay, Mr. 3 and Jesus Burges are never playable. characters like Eustace Kid, Gin, Corazone, and Vander Deken (for better or worse) aren't even mentioned at all. Here lies my biggest gripe with PW3, the way it mangles the story of One Piece and its characters. \r\n\r\nI understand Adaptational changes needed to be made, of course they did, but the way they did it feels lazy and strange. Romance Dawn, an arc that spans only 3 episodes in Included as a full 20 minute level, but Little Garden, which spans 8, is skipped completely. Punk Hazard, which is a full 46 episodes, is condensed into the same 20 minute length as the 8 episode Gaya. The 33 episode Marineford is separated into 2 40 minute levels! The story is mangled from the anime and manga, and this is by far the weakest element of the whole game. The ending of the Dressrosa arc is game original, not reflecting the anime or manga, and it shows. The ending of the story is abysmal, and I'm not just saying that because it's different. \r\n\r\nIf you've been paying attention it's probably clear that I know a lot and have a great appreciation for the story of One Piece and how it was crafted, and I've been getting upset whenever they change something to make it worse. Dressrosa ended in 2015, and the game came out that same year. As a result, they didn't know how the arc would end, and the plot suffers greatly because of that. The Tontatta did not yet exist when PW3 was released, so it cover's the plot up to greenbit faithfully, and then falls apart completely. Fujitora becomes another one of Doflamingo's goons, and none of the Donquixote family appear in the game, not even characters like Baby 5 who existed well before. Kuzan arrives and becomes an ally, and Blackbeard &amp; Sakazuki also begin working for Doflamingo, who ends up escaping anyway! If you are paying attention to the plot in game, and care even a little, it will utterly disappoint, and the ending ruins what enjoyment I was getting from it.\r\n\r\nI want to talk about this game's biggest flaw, in my opinion. For each level, there are 9 optional objectives you can perform to complete a 9x9 photo called a legend, which are then combined into a bigger 5 x 6 portrait and I will never be completing this portrait. Most of the requirements are fine, things like defeating a boss as a certain character, or achieving a certain number of KOs, but one requirement...is impossible. One of the 8 Dream Log requirements is to achieve an S rank on every single boring tedious repetitive island. to get an S overall, you need to get 3 smaller S ranks. and S in time, KOs and ! KOs. it's those last 2 that pose the biggest problem. to get an S rank in both, you need to constantly be micromanaging your Kizuna gauges, using Specials as soon as they are available, and fail certain objectives on purpose to get enough normal and ! KOs to actually even get close to an S. ON TOP OF THAT, it's not guaranteed that you'll get a map with enough bases and enemies to actually hit above an A. Just like Hyrule and Fire Emblem Warriors (the other two warriors games I've played), This fun and worth-wile experience gets bogged down and ruined by the completion requirements. Although, the Legend is optional, so It's not ruined per say.",

It's so well designed, fleshed out, and balanced. The emblems add a ton of gameplay options as well. Of course, the issue with Engage is that the story is just bad. There's no sugar coating it, it's poorly written and generic. I wish they had put as much thought into the story here as they did on Three Houses because that's what's really holding this game back. The characters are a mixed bag, some I really like and some (like the story) are generic and boring. I guess it depends on your preferences. There were a few small story moments that I liked, but overall it makes it hard to go back to, even if I really enjoyed playing it.\r\n\r\nOverall Score: 7/10\r\n",

          "content": "I believe with the Smash Brothers series you have it's ups and its down, (Smash 4.)  It's been 10 years since I've enjoyed a Smash Brothers game with that being Brawl for the Nintendo Wii. For me a game can easily and quickly rope me in by having a beautiful story, deep meaning, and good gameplay and a lot of games I play most of the time miss the mark. Brawl's Subspace mode was special to me and already played Melee and the 64 version of the game I was blown away- I never played anything like Brawl before. So, not to go into detail about Brawl since this is an Ultimate review I'll make it short.\n\nBrawl opened a door for me in story telling that I never thought I'd actually love. Me being 9 years old when playing the game I wasn't aware that these Nintendo faces had a bigger and badder threat looming over them, this threat is Tabuu. Since then I have always told myself Brawl will always be special to me for making me invested in this world. For Example seeing Ness and Lucas on the same screen interacting with each other was something bonkers for me. Mainly because as a lot of people who's had one conversation with me knows Earthbound is my all time favorite game. So seeing Nintendo acknowledge these legends was something I would've never expected in my wildest dreams. \nContinuing forth with Smash 4 (ahahaha, see?)\nI did not like Smash 4. \n\nNow Ultimate - the game I've waited 10 years for, a game that upon announcement made me do something that hadn't happened since the announcement of God of War (2018.) And that was scream so loud I literally strained my vocal chords and I was unable to speak at a certain volume for a few days. Now honestly I shouldn't have screamed becasue in the back of my mind I thought; it'll probably be just another Smash 4 where a lot of the game isn't my tea and I still won't see Ice Climbers. I was wrong. Watching every Official Nintendo Announcement regarding Ultimate was life changing every time and with the success of the Nintendo Switch it's a game I had high hopes for. \n\nLet's start off with the game itself, how it feels, how it plays. The game is fast paced, this isn't anything new for the series at all. But when you go from Brawl to Ultimate you feel a bit more grounded feel. Where characters instead of being floaty and light. Almost feel and play like they look. For example, the first thing I did when booting up the game was go to Classic mode and play captain falcon. He is this really thin character with quick movements and fast and fluid punches. \nBefore the release of Smash Ultimate I did play Smash 4 to get a feel on what I missed out on and quickly switching from Smash 4 to Smash 5 (6 since Sakruai considers Smash wii u and Smash 3ds to be different games, there's your fun fact of the day) it was not a drastic change and I learned things primarily by testing what worked in Smash 4 and what works in this installment. Which you'd be surprised is a lot. I won't lie I'm not a big vocab user and at the end of the day I am just a guy with a nose. \n\nMoving forward  on with Adventure mode; spirits. A mode that for me felt like it wasn't as great as Subspace but I do feel tone they were going for. After running about 30+ hours in the Adventure mode I could appreciate the many fights it gives you the fact that a lot of fights are never the same and will either be a finger tearing challenge or a walk in the park.  It is pretty much after the first areas what you see is what you get. There is New Game Plus after you beat the main story, which i haven't started admittedly but the Spirits will keep you invested in the Adventure mode with different approaches to each fight. \n\nOnline mode is Online. Nothing has really changed if one of the players you play even has the thought of going into a 3 bar connection it will tank and you will be mashing hoping it'll let go soon. It's also really bare when it comes to it's features online, there isn't much of a co-op online. like why can't I play Smashdown Online? Why? That'll be amazing literally amazing. Or why can't I run classic online? Atleast with a friend?? Options like these have an easy work around with using things like Parsec (which I'm trying to figure that out still.)  Moving forward Online would be a miss if it wasn't one of the main focuses of the game.\n\nSmash - core modes, everything is the same with the exception of Smashdown and the new and improved Custom Battle mode. I never cared much for other modes but in Ultimate it feels almost as if was tweaked so you can throw yourself in almost in situation and find different solutions in and out of any battle. let's see, there's super sudden death mode which is absolutely insane and every moment of it makes me nervous and my heart pound with anxiety. \n\nIn conclusion Super Smash Brothers Ultimate takes something from each Smash game and builds upon that with love and care. Although I am critical of Smash for the Wii u/3DS I would have to thank it for being the successor and having good mechanics which are made better in this one. Sorry this took so long to make, sickness, personal family things and overall laziness I would recommend this game to newcomers and veterans. -12/22/2018 2 weeks after the game came out.\n",

          "content": "I have never played another Fire Emblem game. The only thing I knew of the series were the characters in Smash Bros. However, with this game I decided to give it a try and holy sh*t my mind was blown by how good this game was! \n\nThe story is super intriguing and characters are all (except Ignatz and Cyril) wonderfully written and you become connected with them. I chose Black Eagles as my house for my first run and I couldn't put the game down for the whole weekend, luckily it was summer vacation so I had lots of time to play (which you'll need for this game lol). I honestly can't really explain everything I love about this game from the first time I played but I remember the story was really captivating and engaging. The gameplay is fun and not as boring as I originally thought. At times you'll really struggle on some maps (unless you're a strategy game veteran, I suppose) and I really enjoyed the challenge although I will admit the game was kinda easy at times but for my first time playing a strategy game I got challenged enough. \n\nWhen I finished my first run with Black Eagles, I immediately wanted to play the next one. I chose the Blue Lions. I was blown away by how different each house's story is! It's not like you'll choose one house and get the same thing, nono. Each house could seriously be it's own game cause of how differently they play out. I was amazed by this. I knew of Fire Emblem Fates for the 3DS which had a similar thing but they sold that as different games; Birthright and Conquest. Here you get it all in one game. The Blue Lions route focuses a lot more on characters than the overarching narrative and it's so freaking good. It's impossible not to connect with the characters in this game. \n\nFor my third playthrough I chose, of course, Golden Deer. This was the house that I was least interested in but oh my was I wrong to think that. I think this route's story might be my favorite along Black Eagles. It's difficult to chose a favorite to be honest, cause all of them are great. After I finished the third run, I started a fourth. This is because of (small spoiler?) the fact that there is a fourth route. I could not get more blown away by how much effort went into this game and how much you get for your money! I was satisfied after my first run, but after playing all of them I dont think \"satisfied\" is the right word anymore.\n\nAlso, the new things you learn in the different routes will change your perspective on other characters and their motivations when you know more about them. I can't tell you how many secret details lie in this game and it's so fun to connect the dots by yourself (or online as well). \n\nBefore I forget; this soundtrack is amazing! Seriously every song in this game is a banger, I kid you not. \n\nI was so obsessed with this game for the longest time that I went out of my way to get *every* support conversation between all the characters. To put it simply, I'm 100% it. There is also the season pass that is definitely worth the money. It adds a new story that is of the same quality as the main game, and new characters to use. Along with new amazing music tracks. \n\n11/10 game, and it shares the spot of my favorite of all time along with Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix. Even if you've never played a Fire Emblem game or a strategy game before (like I hadn't) please try this one out. One route takes maybe around 40 hours but by the time I finished my fourth run I was at 200...then I started my 5th run. No, I'm not joking. Although that is on a pause for now.  ",

          "content": "Fire Emblem: Three Houses is perhaps the most solid game in the series. It has everything you could want out of a Fire Emblem game: great characters, a compelling plot, and deep strategy gameplay.\n\nThe aspect that makes this game stand out of course, is its characters and storyline. Every character feels complete and complicated. You end up liking all of them, even the ones from rival houses. The house leads, especially, are given strong portrayals and motivations. Its easy to see where each of them are coming from, making it difficult to make the more impactful decisions later in the game.\n\nIn terms of the amount of content you will experience for each house, I do think that your experience could vary. I played as the Black Eagles house, which I believe likely has the most amount of content and plot twists to it. I don't know if I would have had the same reaction to one of the big twists in the middle of the game if I had been playing as one of the other houses. That being said, in order to get the full story, you really need to play all four available routes. I definitely feel that there were plot points left unexplored in my playthrough, and reading the wiki afterwards confirmed this. That isn't necessarily a negative, as it gives you a good reason to do another run.\n\nThe core gameplay is the complex turn-based strategy. Managing your equipment and units is crucial, and it really makes you think deeply about how to win each battle.\n\nThe support system is implemented really well, allowing you to see characters develop over the course of the game. Their relationships with each other will change, you will get more insight into their past and motivations, and you will see them learn and grow.\n\nOne character complaint that I do have is Byleth. As the main character, the developers clearly wanted you to insert yourself into Byleth's situation, which is why they are the only character that does not talk during cutscenes. I found this, however, to be incredibly distracting, given that they aren't just a self-insert character. They have their own motivations, opinions, and desires, so it is really weird that the most you get out of them is a line of text at a time. I still found myself liking them as a character, I just wish they were given more voice lines.\n\nAlso, the music is great.\n\nOverall Score: 10/10",

There's a good amount of gameplay variety and all the Peach designs are great, but there's a noticeable lack of any real challenge. That in of itself isn't a bad thing, not every game has to be challenging and the primary audience for this game is younger kids, but difficulty options wouldn't have hurt either. Really the only glaring flaw for me is how this game loves to waste your time if you're going for 100% completion. You'll have to play through each level at least twice to get everything, but there is no way to skip any of the in-level dialogue or cutscenes, which makes every subsequent attempt/playthrough of a level feel way more tedious than it needs to be.\n\nFun game overall but it's quite short for the asking price of $60, I'd argue $40 is a much more fair price",

Over 400 in-game hours later I can safely say this game is a real workout! I've played through the game's story on New Game+ and New Game++ and unlocked literally everything. I turned the grind into an exercise session and I used the item unlocks as points to mark my progress. What I like most about this game is it's a workout without feeling like it's really \"work\". You're moving and active doing things like squats and scissor kicks and jogging in place and all of this is getting your heart rate up but it still feels like you're just playing a game, Ring Fit Adventure is that good. The story is charming and the characters are likable and as the game's tale unfolds you'll want to push yourself through just one more level to find out what happens next. My only real complaint with Ring Fit Adventure is certain exercises have certain attack \"types\" that are effective against specific enemies. You'll eventually unlock the max level exercises that are effective against everything universally but when you're just starting out you have to do certain motions to attack specific enemies.",

I am incredibly tired of defeating Bowser and Boswer Jr, and, even though Nintendo is not famous for its engrossing stories, they could try to be a bit more creative on that end as well. The gameplay is incredibly varied and full of crazy ideas, though they are sometimes a bit random and out of place. I get that it is part of the idea for the Wonder Flowers to create unexpected situations, but it also sometimes feels like they just didn't care to create a coherent whole. The introduction of Badges with unique powers is amazing, providing numerous different ways to approach a level, though I miss the triple jump from previous iterations. ",

It really feels like a fresh start, differentiating itself from the \"New\" series in art style, level design, and, most importantly, creativity. The new powers are fun to use. The level design is much more varied. The music, sound design, and art style are all top-notch. The new voice of Mario is also doing a great job. The biggest complaint, as with most 2D Mario games, is the boss fights. In particular, the midpoint/checkpoint bosses are incredibly easy to fight, repetitive, and uninteresting. The main boss fights are a bit better, but I would still like to see the series improve on this aspect in future titles.\r\n\r\nOverall Score: 9/10",

          "content": "Kirby Star Allies is a decent platformer with great boss fights.\n\nKirby's moves and abilities feel really epic and fun to plan and experiment with. Finding your favorite ability is a lot of fun, especially when you combine different abilities. That being said, Kirby's movement is a little clunky. Walking is pretty slow.\n\nThe allies system is an interesting concept, although it can get frustrating when your allies get themselves killed for stupid reasons. There were a few times when my allies would get crushed by moving platforms even though I was far away from them. With four allies, the screen can also get crowded, especially in cramped spaces, that sometimes makes it hard to keep track of what's going on.\n\nThe platforming sections are pretty lackluster. Standard platforming without much interesting or anything of note. Feels like the developers forgot that Kirby can fly when they were designing some sections since there are a lot of platforming challenges that you can just fly over.\n\nThe highlight of Kirby Star Allies is the boss fights. The moves are creative and provide a good challenge. The final set of fights is especially well done and feels really epic. The boss fights are what really elevate the game beyond a somewhat dull platformer.\n\nMusic and sounds are fine, nothing too special. The same can be said about the graphics, which are good in some parts, although when there are a bunch of entities on screen the frame rate will tank. These situations are pretty rare though.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10",

It feels so natural that it's surprising Kirby hasn't had a 3D game before.\n\nThe game has a very unique atmosphere to it. Each level feels unique and offers different challenges. The levels and layout feel very reminiscent of Super Mario Galaxy.\n\nEach boss fight has a great set of challenges that feels very rewarding once you figure out how to best counter a cycle. The final boss fight especially stands out as one of the best boss fights I've played recently.\n\nKirby's abilities feel responsive and powerful. Each has its benefits, and there weren't any that I felt like avoiding. The new ability in this game, the 'mouthful mode' provides a ton of fun and interesting challenges.\n\nThe art-style makes everything pop and the graphics are impressive for the Switch. Music and sounds are a big plus as well. The only issue here is that the framerate of far-away objects' animations is reduced for performance reasons. It isn't a big issue, but it does become jarring sometimes.\n\nOverall, this is a great first 3D entry in the Kirby series and I had trouble putting it down.\n\nOverall Score: 10/10",

          "content": "One of the best Mario 3D platformers around, Super Mario Odyssey fulfilled my love of Mario Sunshine and Mario 64 in a huge way. The world is brilliant and often breathtaking at times, with some levels standing out in a huge way. There are many interesting secrets to be found, as you collect various coins and trinkets throughout your journey, and even a fun new game + after you finish the main story. \n\nThis is certainly a modern classic waiting to be archived as such, on par with some of the best Mario and 3D platforming titles available. The ability to possess objects and enemies with your hat is novel and interesting, and leads to a variety of puzzle solving capabilities. The unique costumes add a flair to the game and allow the player some choice, albeit in a shallow fashion, but better than many Nintendo games of the same ilk. I loved playing this game, but would offer that my enjoyment began to flag toward the end, as the repetitive task of gathering coins and power moons began to feel samey. This criticism is personally affected, as this is more of a challenge I face with the 3D platformer genre, and will certainly not apply to every gamer. The very unique and stunning levels did help alleviate this some, as did the interesting puzzles to solve. \n\nThe stunning level design was interesting, with some standout levels that were jaw dropping to view from certain angles. The variety and location of puzzles offered many surprises, meaning excellent level design. One small criticism of some areas was the jarring cut off of the playscape, making some levels feel like zones, which broke the fourth wall for me a tad and reduced my overall enjoyment of some areas. This is a small criticism, as the level design here on the whole is superb and gorgeous from most angles. \n\nAll in all, a wonderful experience and truly a mainstay of the Switch's library of titles. Easy recommendation for fans of Mario and Nintendo fare, and those who enjoy a laid back 3D platforming experience, with wonderful worlds to behold. ",

Finding a moon can sometimes happen every few seconds, which means individual ones have no impact. I wanted to complete a world before continuing, which was not possible, since many moons can only be collected post-game.\nThe game seriously lacks difficulty until post-game and never challenges the player to really show the moves he learned.\nSome of the boss fights are cool, but some of them are really boring. All of them are piss easy.\nThe boring broodals boss fights are recycled so many times.\n\nI had a lot of fun with the game, but did not have the desire to revisit every kingdom in post-game again and look under every rock for moons.",

Fatum Betula is a relatively short game with at least a dozen endings and the choices you make during the brief main game determine which ending you will get. Gameplay is centered around collecting samples of liquids with vials and either mixing them or adding the samples to other things to create new mixtures. The ultimate goal of the game is to water the Tree of Life with one of your samples with each sample giving you a different ending. The game is bizarre and while it's listed as a \"horror\" game I don't feel like the game is actually scary per se, it just has a very unsettling atmosphere. I'll never forget the biblically accurate angel who informed me that I was going to \"go to Hell in real life\".",

The items I found were not interesting, and I noticed a large amount of healing which meant taking damage was almost arbitrary, so you're constantly taking damage and constantly healing. 45 minutes probably isn't a fair shout, but I really don't want to play any more. I imagine the game is fun with friends, and probably does get better when you find more interesting stuff later on, but it's certainly not enough to grab me right now.",

This adds a sense of urgency and prompts strategic decisions about exploration, combat engagement, and progression. Notably, the soundtrack is so good that at times, it can sabotage your run, tempting you to stay on a level longer than you should.\n\nBeyond its rich character design, dynamic difficulty, and awesome music, Risk of Rain 2 shines with its seamless gameplay flow, diverse environments and carefully crafted enemies, making it an absolute blast.",

It\u2019s a game where there are no limits to your potential set, and you can become as overpowered as you desire. \nIt does follow the traditional rouge-lite formula. Fight through a level, while collecting as much loot as possible, kill the boss, and continue onwards. The major difference here is that it's actually 3D. \nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the genre or just wants a fun time-killer. It also has multiplayer.\n\nStory\nYou are a member of a spaceship responding to a distress beacon sent from an unknown planet. In an attempt to find any survivors, you get sent down, completely unprepared for what\u2019s to come.\nThe story is there mainly to set the scene. There isn\u2019t much of any narrative while actually playing the game. Still, for those interested, there is quite a lot of lore, as every item and enemy has a description. \n\nMechanics and gameplay\nAs I said, it follows the standard rouge-lite formula seen in many other titles like Enter the Gungeon, The Binding of Isaac, and many others. It is simple, but highly effective and addictive. What sets Risk of Rain 2 apart from the others, and allowed it to become such a popular game, is its lack of restrains.\nThere aren\u2019t any limits on how many times you can find a duplicate item or how fast you can clear a stage and so on. Becoming overpowered is the point. Being skilful at this game isn\u2019t just about being able to dodge all the projectiles, it's about being able to maximize whatever loot you are given to create a build that can take you to the end and beyond. \n\nGraphics/Artstyle\nIt's simplistic and by no means detailed. Still, I can\u2019t imagine there will be a time when this game will look ugly and outdated. It\u2019s a timeless design that conveys what it has to.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion  \nThe atmosphere is all over the place, first, you fight robots and bugs in a tundra, then lizard men and jellyfish in a desert then\u2026 you get the idea. Although perhaps because it never takes itself seriously, it works. It's distinctly \u201cRisk of Rain\u201d. \n\nSoundtrack \nAn incredible soundtrack has been made for this game, and I can\u2019t imagine any other that would fit so well. My favourite part is \u201cThe Rain Formerly Known as Purple\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nMe when the weather reports show that there is a risk of rain.\n",

Nothing to regret playing \"free to play\" beta game with eye candy characters and also interesting mechanic to train my reflex for fast paced shooters where I enjoy the game mostly for casual play.\n\nAnd here I am, after spending 500 hours and grinding each characters for leveling each characters to reach 10 level, I think I am kind of done playing online game like this all this year and back to my productive sessions or playing some good-narrative video games and leave some review on Steam, maybe I just play less than three matches and done.\n\nIn each session, i was rage for stupid team-mates who dont know their role and it also gives ego-fest for each players who think playing team based games just go random jihad and blindly attack enemy.\n\nI was so satisfied with intense and competitive session where everyone take things seriously and ended have \"good game\" pops up on chat section where even though we are losing, players just get satisfied to get balance and intense battle. Sometimes, i face most dumbos enemy that are too easy to beat and lag is the only factors to decide are you going to win or not instantly.\n\nI think this is the game where I was so doubt that free to play strategy wont attract players spending their wallet for cosmetics, guess I was so wrong.. the way game is marketed so appealing and most of the cosmetics for each characters dont have that \"buyer remorse\" to have. I bought the founder pack for unlocking each characters and also VIP membership where I think its because I fully support the developer to make this game is going full potential because its still on development.\n\nThe only thing I expect from this game is single player mode with lore and things to do for specific mission against bots, not only pushing payloads or 5v5 random battle for grinding and unlocking loot boxes to improve characters ability\n\nPaladins is kind of game where you have to be ready to understand what if FPS is mixed with moba skills where each characters should have be mastered to gain satisfying gameplay, and also it has competitor with high price tag while this game is free but if you like it, you wont mind to buy for full price.",

          "content": "[ENGLISH]\nThe first thing is to settle the famous controversy that this title plagiarizes Overwatch. I am a constant player of Overwatch and Paladins. I have played many hours in both games (especially Overwatch). And what's more, I played Paladins, as soon as I came out in the Alpha phase, that is, I saw it evolve.\nThe two games feel different. And both are good.\nDo not take revenge on me that one copied the other, because both belong to the same genre. This category is still being developed, it is called \"Hero Shooter\". It consists of some kind of game mode (the most common is to conquer a point and escort a load to a certain point on the map), in which we will take different characters, with their corresponding roles (DPS (damage), Tank (defense ), Healer (healer), etc ...) So, why do not we say that Battlefield is copied from Call Of Duty or vice versa? It is very big nonsense. Both belong to the same gender and period.\n\nNow, I will focus on talking about Paladins.\nIt is an online multiplayer video game that consists of facing a team of five against five on a map. Normally you have to conquer a point.\nOne of the things I like most about this game is the variety of characters and their roles (already mentioned above). We can find human beings, elves, talkative trees, etc ...), each with a distinct and charismatic personality.\nThat is, it is set in a fantasy universe (which I would swear, is shared by the other great title of Hirez Studios, \"Smite\").\nIt is very fun and full of adrenaline.\nThe history of the videogame (Lore), is beginning to emerge.\nAnd it is very interesting that most of the characters, obtain their powers through the crystals that carry over (whether in weapons, clothing, etc ...), hence the diamond icon.\n\nNow, it's not perfect. It has lots of bugs (some can annoy you the game experience), there are things that are wrong in some maps (Corners with no way out ...), the characters do not interact well with the environment (for example, if I want to upload to a platform, the character makes strange movements and many times I died for that ...), etc ... I also miss, a physical attack and the ability to duck the character (although this is subjective). The servers of Hirez Studios, have never been very ... decent (However, the company is very good). But what I hate the most about this title, is the hitbox (it's what defines what part of a character can take damage and how much damage can suffer), is enormously broad in all the characters. For example, you can see many times how to kill you, your enemy was not even being accurate against you (that is, I did not hit the bullets but the game detects that, damaging you).\n\nIn summary, it is a very funny and frenetic game that I recommend you to try. Total, it's free!\n\n\n[ESPA\u00d1OL]\nLo primero es zanjar la famosa polemica de que este t\u00edtulo plagia a Overwatch. Soy un constante jugador de Overwatch y Paladins. Llevo much\u00edsimas horas jugadas a ambos videojuegos (sobre todo a Overwatch). Y es m\u00e1s, jugu\u00e9 a Paladins, nada m\u00e1s salir en fase Alfa, es decir, lo he visto evolucionar.\nLos dos juegos se sienten distintos. Y ambos son buenos.\nNo me veng\u00e1is con que uno se copia del otro, pues los dos pertenecen al mismo g\u00e9nero. Est\u00e1 categor\u00eda que a\u00fan est\u00e1 siendo desarrollada, se le denomina \"Hero Shooter\". Consiste en alg\u00fan tipo de modo de juego (el m\u00e1s habitual, es conquistar un punto y escoltar una carga a un determinado punto del mapa), en el cual llevaremos a diferentes personajes, con sus roles correspondientes (DPS (da\u00f1o), Tanque (defensa), Healer (sanador), etc...) Entonces, \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no decimos que Battlefield se copia de Call Of Duty o viceversa? Es una tonter\u00eda muy grande. Los dos pertenecen al mismo g\u00e9nero y punto.\n  \nAhora s\u00ed, me centrar\u00e9 en hablar de Paladins.\nEs un videojuego online multijugador que consiste en enfrentar un equipo de cinco contra cinco en un mapa. Normalmente hay que conquistar un punto.\nUna de las cosas que m\u00e1s me gustan de este juego, es la variedad de personajes y sus roles (ya mencionados anteriormente). Podemos encontrarnos a seres humanos, elfos, \u00e1rboles parlanchines, etc... ), cada uno con una personalidad distinta y carism\u00e1tica.\nEs decir, est\u00e1 ambientado en un universo de fantas\u00eda (que jurar\u00eda, es compartido por el otro gran t\u00edtulo de Hirez Studios, \"Smite\").\nEs muy divertido y repleto de adrenalina.\nLa historia del videojuego (Lore), est\u00e1 comenzando a surgir. Y es muy interesante que la mayor\u00eda de los personajes, obtengan sus poderes a trav\u00e9s de los cristales que porten encima (ya sea en las armas, ropa, etc...), de ah\u00ed, el icono del diamante.\n\nAhora bien, no es perfecto. Tiene montones de bugs (algunos te pueden fastidiar la experiencia de juego), hay cosas que est\u00e1n mal en algunos mapas (Rincones sin salida...), los personajes no interactuan bien con el entorno (por ejemplo, si me quiero subir a una plataforma, el personaje realiza movimientos extra\u00f1os y muchas veces he muerto por eso...), etc...\nTambi\u00e9n echo en falta, un ataque f\u00edsico y la capacidad de agacharse del personaje (aunque esto es subjetivo). Los servidores de Hirez Studios, nunca han sido muy... decentes (No obstante, la empresa es muy buena). Pero lo que m\u00e1s odio de este t\u00edtulo, es la hitbox (es lo que define qu\u00e9 parte de un personaje puede recibir da\u00f1os y qu\u00e9 cantidad de da\u00f1o puede sufrir), es enormemente amplia en todos los personajes. Por ejemplo, puedes fijarte muchas veces como al asesinarte, tu enemigo ni siquiera estaba siendo preciso contra ti (es decir, no te acertaba las balas pero el juego detecta que s\u00ed, da\u00f1\u00e1ndote).  \n\nEn resumen, es un juego muy divertido y fren\u00e9tico que te recomiendo que pruebes. Total, \u00a1es gratis!",

The characters are perfectly developed, and it really has that small town feel. The witchy part doesn\u2019t bother me (surprisingly), as it is just so innocent and pure as an entire storyline.

          "content": "A 2020 Review - Alien: Isolation (PC, 2014)\n\nScore: 7/10\nMediocrity Score: Not Mediocre\nAlien: Isolation is a death-by-alien simulator masquerading as a first-person survival horror game. Dripping with late-1970s tech-ambiance, Creative Assembly has produced a rather safe narrative that closely follows the original Alien's tale of Ellen Ripley. Not falling far from the tree, the protagonist you play is none other than Amanda Ripley - Ellen Ripley's daughter. In what must feel like the family curse, Amanda is stricken with a far-too-similar fate being stuck on a space station trying to survive against aliens. If you aren't a fan of the series or haven't seen any of the movies - don't sweat it. Just bring an extra pair of underwear and dive into this insanely atmospheric and engrossing experience.\n\nTags: A few words or tags that come to mind are: atmospheric, stressful, powerless, tedious.\n\nAvg. Time to beat: ~20 hours\nQuickest Speedrun: ~2.5 hours (even on nightmare difficulty)\n\n2020 Retail Price: $40\nLowest Historical Price on Steam: $10\nLowest Historical Price outside Steam: $7.50\n\nQuick Take:\u00a0Alien: Isolated is not fun. It is not an enjoyable experience by traditional standards, but it is a horrifically beautiful and a completely immersive one. Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton said it better than anyone else, \"While many a video game has been designed for people who enjoy killing aliens, Alien: Isolation can only have been created for people who derive some perverse pleasure out of being killed by an alien.\" This game in its purest form is an engrossing simulation of how it would feel to try your odds against the alien xenomorphs in a bout of survival. Your odds are very slim. Between the sound engineering and the visual design, the two complement each other like two peas in a pod or...two facehuggers in an egg-sack, if you prefer. Together the two bring about an utter sense of dread, panic, and stress. You can hear the alien scampering through the ventilation; you can see its slimy drool ooze down in wait. You can hear the rich pops and sizzles of the CRT screens and analog devices used throughout the game. From opening production credits to end-game credits, it's a technical marvel...but is it an entertaining one? Well, that's where things get complicated... That's where I begin to feel the ol' quote \"I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride\" becomes relevant again. At 16 hours in, I decided that's all the thrill I'll be getting out of that ride. Are you ever 100% glad you did or tried something, but wouldn't ever do it again? I appreciate Alien: Isolation for having done so much, so right - but I can't say I enjoyed or had fun playing it. It's stressful. I'm a huge horror film buff, yet this is a much longer and interactive experience - one that did not give me that \"just 5 more minutes\" feeling. It was more of a \"where the hell's the savegame telephone at?\"\n\nConcept:\u00a0Aliens (the movie) themed survival horror game. You're Ellen Ripley's unlucky daughter, Amanda - who also finds herself face to face with the same alien species that cost her mother's life. In a fight for survival, will you lead Amanda to her victory or just die 1,000 times trying? Yes. The answer is, yes.\n\nGraphics:\u00a0Impressive. Certainly so by 2014's standards but even for 2020 standards, this offers a high bar to pass. Compliments the audio design incredibly - both pairing together to reel you into the space-station, Sevastopol, along with all its horrors. For users looking to play at minimum or low specs, the game surprisingly doesn't look terrible when adjusted down. It holds up well enough, however, my advice would be to hold off until you can play at top specs. A huge amount of the value comes from the visual and audio. Unless you're easily entertained by horror games, I'd wait until you can get the full experience. It's worth it.\n\nSound:\u00a0The sound design is killer. It breathes life into nothingness and fills the space with dread. From the menu screen, it is apparent that the audio will set the tone through much of the game. Hearing the alien bang around the ship or scamper about in the ventilation is disturbing when you've been hiding in a locker for ten minutes contemplating what actions led you to this awful place.\n\nGameplay:\u00a0In one word - stealth. You will be crouching, hiding under desks, leaning, hiding in lockers, tip-toeing, and generally avoiding anything that moves or makes a sound. This will be much of your gameplay experience for a large portion of the game. Lots of tools and consumables/throwables to aid you in your fight. These won't be useful in killing an alien but should help separate you from the Alien a bit more easily. Unless you've memorized the maps and are an experienced speed-runner - you'll need to take the slow and steady approach. Kicking-down-the-door style of gameplay will get you killed. Although, hiding will mostly do the same. Perhaps my one word for gameplay should have been - dying.\n\nEntertainment:\u00a0Did you like the movies Source Code or Edge of Tomorrow? Then you'll enjoy experiencing it first-hand in an interactive simulator game, only with Aliens and Facehuggers. I found Alien: Isolation to be akin to a thrill-ride. A lot of fun in short bursts, but it is not something most people would enjoy for long stretches. I could only take so much stress and tension before growing tired of it and wanting to move on. \"I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride.\" comes to mind.\n\nReplayability:\u00a0How enjoyable is revisiting the same haunted house over and over again? Sure, the actors will always do things a little differently but it's always the same song and dance in the end. For me, it does not have replay value. It doesn't much affect my purchasing-interest if a game isn't replayable, so I'm cool with it. Maybe you are too.\n\nCheats??:\u00a0None natively. There are existing trainers that can be downloaded and run alongside the game. I didn't find them to be useful or fun and led to achievements halting early on in my play-through. Use at your risk.\n\n\n---Full Review Below---\n\n\nAlien: Isolation is an immersive, first-person survival horror game set in the universe of the popular 1979 movie series, Alien. It provides a linear, puzzle-like progression with sci-fi and horror elements that are reminiscent of the 1999 PC game, Half-Life. You play as Amanda Ripley - Ellen Ripley's daughter. Hunting for answers relating to her mother's disappearance fifteen years ago - Amanda arrives at the retired space station, Sevastopol. She soon discovers the station has been ravaged by the same Alien that her mom had once faced. Going up against the legendary alien Xenomorphs is a terrifying experience to endure. A position you will find yourself far too regularly.\n\nCreative Assembly has created a game true to its source material. Die-hard fans of the series are rewarded with its similar effect on the senses. Its richness and melding of audio, visuals, and narrative are a strong part of what made the original film so great. Alien: Isolation provides a horrifying simulation of facing the alien parasites head-on and struggling for your own survival. The unnerving atmosphere seeps its way through the halls and corridors of the maze-like Sevastopol station. I applaud the creators for doing an excellent job recreating the same intensity and unease as the films. The game surpasses the movies in many regards, including its effectiveness at bringing the audience in for a much closer, more frightful experience. Even in 2020, there is no better way to experience the thrill of being trapped on-board with the Alien Xenomorphs. It's a harrowing engagement to play this death-by-Alien simulator, and as the player, you get a real sense of what it might be like to have to defend yourself and survive against one. \n\nThe story falls a bit flat and too closes mirrors its source of inspiration. I can forgive the creators for not wanting to alter a working story-formula too much. Especially when the original worked so well. But this story feels shoehorned into place. It works, but it's not interesting and takes a back seat to everything else. Maybe it helps the Alien AI and horror elements stay in the spotlight. Maybe keeping a potentially too-radical story from imposing too heavily upon the game's features. I don't know. But to me, a more compelling story would have made for better cohesion thus more driving power during the slower, more repetitive parts. Instead, we have to endure an already long, stressful journey with lower motivation to continue forward. \n\nMuch of the game's effectiveness stems from its sound and visual direction. From the very second it launches, the player is met with a rich, filling audio that tickles the ear with its static hums and hisses. If it weren't for the technical accomplishments of the audio and visual, Alien: Isolation would be far less than the success that it is. Honestly, this might be the most stand-out game in terms of its audio design and ability to draw in the player with sound alone. It's an impressive achievement. The throwback themes of the late-70s technology are strewn about. Looking to the past for inspiration, the Sevastopol space station's design and appearance bring us right back to the same point in time that the original Ellen Ripley found herself face-to-face with the Xenomorphs. Warped CRT screens, static-noise eliminating from the security tuner box, or the beeps and blips from the motion detector are all great examples of the aesthetic the design team worked into the game. I feel like the flamethrower and Molotov could have better flame effects; the flames don't last long enough, the smoke effect is very weak, and could have made for a more serious impact in its use. \n\nThe Alien has both the most advanced and impressive AI designs, as well as the most frustrating ones to endure. It never gives up, it never relents. It's realistic to the series. For sure, this is how the Alien would behave if hunting you - but it is frustratingly difficult to progress the game at times. It is true, no two reloads of a save game are the same. The Alien does not always follow the same path. It shadows you, learning your habits and tendencies. It adapts to your play-style to better get the drop on you. While impressive, this makes for a very challenging experience in avoiding its traps. The other enemy type, Androids, are very thorough in their scans and sweeps when they see or hear you. If you are outside of a vent or locker, they'll find you rather quickly. The Androids, formally named \"Working Joes\", are the physical form of the APOLLO AI mainframe system. The APOLLO system provides security, communications, monitoring, and Android orchestration to the Sevastopol station. Alien: Isolation fumbles powerfully in its attempt at creating consistent human animations of movement and speech. Non-combative human-AI behavior and mannerisms are uncomfortable and confusing. The humans act skittish to a cartoon extent, just shy of a parody. They wail about in terror, while also frequently getting stuck in place halting all emotion. Cut-scene animations commonly have audio and video synchronization problems with mouth-movements and voices falling out of sync. \n\nFear, panic, and stress will be the prevailing emotions throughout playing. This game is about stealth and silence. It's difficult. You'll die a tremendous amount, often in startling ways. You cannot kill the Alien. You can trick it to go looking for you elsewhere (via equipment/throwables) or you can temporarily scare it away with a flamethrower. Rushing the Alien will mostly earn you another death animation. The androids will stop and hurt you before you can land a blow. Rushing around the map will make more noise and attract the Alien to your location all the quicker. This will likely wear down certain players, keeping them from finishing the game. It's frustrating and leads to replaying and re-accomplishing goals until you can hopefully get to the next save-phone. Watch-out! - if you save with the Alien right behind you, guess what will still be behind you once you reload? \n\nFor all the hassle required to finish, I found the end cut-scenes and conclusion to be lackluster. There were several times I felt like quitting out of frustration. It shines brightest within the first 4-8 hours while the horror and intrigue is still fresh and alive, and before any of it becomes tedious or repetitive. As much I enjoyed the many thrills Alien: Isolation has to offer, it was rather taxing on my ability or will to keep playing. Having an unsatisfying story, the game failed to hold-together my motivation to help power me through some of the more difficult or slower parts. Nonetheless, this release serves as a standout technical achievement for the genre. It accomplishes staying true to the movies, being masterfully designed in its cohesiveness between the sound and visual designs, and is powerfully scary to experience. \n\nThe worst thing I can say is that through all its thrills and immersion, I never found it to be a fun experience. It's one I'm glad I had, but not one I enjoyed much. I think this might be the case for many players or potential ones. It's made for a difficult game to review; how do I recommend something that I did not enjoy? My advice is to view i like a thrill-ride. Look for a low price point (have seen it go for $10 on Steam) and keep expectations realistic. I don't see the need to put more than 4-10 hours to really get the full experience. If you scare or get startled easily, perhaps see if any of your friends have a copy you could check out with them. It's absolutely worth experiencing but I'm not convinced the price for admission is priced right for most of the year. At being 6 years old, I feel $40 is quite a reach. $20 seems fairer - but I personally would wait until it falls to $10 or less.\n\n\nThanks for reading!",

Instead, it became a nightmare game to finish.\n\nI so wish this game was a quarter of its length. It quickly became monotonous.\n\nI love the soundtrack and the level design. The tension that the game set is unique. But I hate everything that developers forced onto the player. \n\nDo you want to go at your own pace? No, here's a random teleporting alien that will instantly kill you. Take it slow! And they mean extremely slow. Plus 5 hours of not fun.\n\nDo you want to explore? Guess what we have for you? Forced save system. So every time you die exploring stuff, you will have to start over. Plus 5 hours of unneeded repetition.\n\nDo you believe in second chances? Haha. Plus 5 hours of unskippable routine work. Fun's overrated.\n\nDo you hate traveling? What? We made such *amazing scenery* so there's no waypoint traveling for you. You have to take the corridor route that was predetermined. Plus 5 hours of running around. If you're bad at making alien friends, add another 5 hours.\n\nWhen to play the game?\n- If you enjoy being killed by the Alien. A lot.\n- If slow-paced scary games are your thing.\n- If you're a fan of the Alien franchise works.\n- If you enjoy visuals and sound design more than engaging gameplay.\n\nVerdict: Play it or watch it?\nRather watch it.",

I mostly stuck to the shotgun for humans and android, and then the flamethrower to scare off the Alien when need be.\r\n\r\nRight away though Alien Isolation is a game that really allows you to get immersed with very minimal HUD on your screen, allowing you to get absorbed in the world of Alien. The atmosphere is always tense and you feel like everything wants to kill you from the enemies, to the space station that is constantly falling apart. It also provides some good horror that never felt cheap or lazy, it just felt right.\r\n\r\nStory is pretty decent and feels like it fits in well with the movies, with themes of corporate corruption and the people who get caught in the crossfire. The twists can be a bit predictable if your well versed in the movies, but otherwise it was very entertaining. The ending was a big let down though and I can see now why fans of this game have been begging for a sequel. It ends in a unsatisfying way and if they really do never make a sequel (that's not a mobile game) then I'm going to be left feeling very unsatisfied.",

The plot was usually fairly easy to follow but there are points where they include things that aren't necessarily related to the game or just straight don't make sense. I liked the ability to see whether you had made the right deduction at the end of a chapter, I kind of wish they had added a link to your decisions further in the game. Not anything big like it completely changing the outcome of further chapters but maybe the other characters being mentioned or something, I'm not sure but it would have added a nice little touch to it. Puzzles were fairly good, not too easy and not too hard. The very end section confused me for some reason, I think because I couldn't work out if this was a dream segment or really happening. Character development was well balanced, not too much or too little. There were some timed actions in the game, not many, but some of them had quite strange animation going on. Overall, preferred Testament of Sherlock Holmes but this is still pretty good, still need to go back and finish all the steam achievements.",

          "content": "I really liked this metroidvania with retro-aesthatics. \r\nThe game is set in a large interconnected tower which you will gradually ascend as you acquire new abilities. You also unlock elevators as you progress to allow you to fast-travel.\r\nThe game's main gimmick is that you control on of three characters, each with their own separate abilities that you need to progress. To switch you have to go to a campsite. This works well for the early parts and you need to decide which character you need for the challenges ahead. However, it can get tedious if you find yourself in a dead-end and you know you have to go back to the last campsite and back again. I would have preferred if a certain item was obtainable a little earlier.\r\nIf you die \r\nThe items and abilities you can find are varied. Some are mandatory, some are optional.\r\nThere are also differently colored keys that you need to open some doors. Silver keys are needed to progress, blue keys open up optional areas and red keys open up segments to powerful items or bosses.\r\nThere is also a very light roguelite element: \r\nIf you die, you can purchase permanent upgrades for each character. Then you are sent back to the base of the tower. \r\nThis makes you stronger after each death, but oftentimes you have to backtrack relatively far to the point that you died, even with the elevators. And you cannot heal, not even really at campsites (you stock up the ability to heal once per boss you beat, but if you use it, it is gone forever). There are some movement upgrades, but many rooms are designed in a way that make backtracking slow.\r\nWhile backtracking may be slow, in general the level design is really good. With areas looping around on themselves and then opening up small shortcuts.\r\nAlso, one specific character is much more powerful in terms of DPS, so it is a wise idea to invest your upgrades in him.",

I like that games don't spoon-feed you the story and make you think about it, and this game does it spectacularly. The story isn't told through documents, narrators, or characters; it's purely environmental storytelling  and it's up to you to pay attention to them to understand what's happening, which I love. \nGameplay-wise, it's very simple, nothing special. No combat which is a good thing cause it makes you feel helpless. There are several fairly easy puzzles, but really good nonetheless. The enemies are really scary, they're deformed people who basically play cat and mouse with you. Each one has its own peculiarity, one is blind but has sharp hearing, another is weak against its own reflection, and so on. These weaknesses are visually shown, but their strengths are very well implemented. For example, with the blind enemy, the floor is made of boards that make noise, but there are carpets where you don't make noise, and the first time it hears you is when you step on a loose board. From that first moment I knew I was gonna love the game. \nThe DLC ''Secrets of the Maw'' is cool, it's about 3 hours long and very well done, where they add new enemies and other areas with new mechanics. The final area gave me Resident Evil vibes. \nAll and all, props to the team. Really good game.",

          "content": "TL,DR:\nThe finale of the Rocksteady's Arkham trilogy, Arkham Knight had some horrible PC issues at launch that have been resolved. Looks amazing even now, runs really well with a lot of content even if the main villain is a little bland. Don't use the bat-mobile like it's Burnout Paradise and you'll be fine.\n\nFull Review:\nHalloween night falls upon Gotham City nine months since the events of Arkham City, and the peace that Batman has worked to maintain has been shattered to pieces by Scarecrow. His deployment of Fear Gas has pushed the city to evacuate its citizens and forces what's left of GCPD to struggle to maintain order as Scarecrow works to cripple the city and unmask Batman. Of course Scarecrow isn't alone and the playing field has changed with the appearance of the Arkham Knight, a new adversary with a private military force at his disposal with a grudge to see Batman suffer. The other villains won't sit idly by and have their own plans for Gotham even after the events of Arkham City, with moments that will leave Batman to question his sanity.\n\nRocksteady does a great job of using the generational leap to really let this rouges gallery shine to spectacular effect. Facial animation is really well done in cut-scenes and main character models have an incredible amount of detail. The cities districts and other locations each feel like they have a personality more than ever with places like Panessa Studios, referencing the eras of cinema in Gotham City to the mix of high-tech and noir influences in the GCPD Building, you'll be hard-pressed to find a location that doesn't feel hand-crafted on an expert level.\n\nJumping right in, the combat system will be instantly familiar for anyone who's played the other Arkham games. As always, the right timing and variety in your combos will go a long way in gaining experience points. The predator system hasn't really changed too much with more variety going into take-down options. These can really turn the tide on higher difficulty so plan wisely.\n\nThe biggest addition here is the Batmobile, the driving mode is what you'd expect but handles well and has a look that sort of between The Tumbler from The Dark Knight &amp; The Batmobile from Superman vs Batman. The more controversial 2nd mode changes things up a lot, you can transition to its combat mode at will which controls sort of like a nimble tank. Some players took issue with it and I think it's because they think it should control like Need for Speed rather than its own thing. One thing to mention is that the combat encounters for the Bat-tank can happen a little too frequent at times, switching between main story and side activities can help alleviate that.\n\nSide content varies depending on what you find interesting, the side villains are the highlight with unique environments, stories, &amp; combat scenarios. They'll also have different dialog depending on when you do them, especially if you save them after completing the endgame. You'll of course have the Riddler trophies to get with varying degrees of challenge, AR missions for Bat-tank, &amp; some racing missions that all help to give the impression that the city is one giant puzzle.\n\nEnemies are what you'd expect depending on which villain you're facing off. Much like Arkham City, most of them are largely the same early on with costume or different melee weapon changes that reflect their faction. Henchmen AI has been improved on higher difficulties so think fast and plan accordingly if you're looking for a real challenge.\n\nBatman: Arkham Knight had a terrible PC launch with performance issues across the board and WB having to take over to clean up the port by Iron Galaxy. Fast forward over 5 years later and things couldn't be better with Rocksteady recently patching out the WBPlay account system &amp; Denuvo DRM. With a relatively decent GPU, it looks fantastic and is well optimized short of a few dated NVIDIA features. Feel free to use the in-game benchmark to see what works for your system.\n\nI'll also mention that there is a fairly long comic book tie-in series that's actually pretty good as well as an animated movie. I wouldn't say these are a requirement but they do add to the backstory which can feel a bit lacking in certain moments. The season pass also does a decent job of it but I'll save my thoughts on that in a separate review.\n\nIt's a great time to jump into the finale of the Arkham trilogy. Some might find the controls of the Bat-Tank to be divisive but you get used to it quickly enough, just don't treat it like Burnout and you'll be fine. I also don't think the Arkham Knight ends up being the best antagonist, YMMV on how familiar you are with other Batman material. This Dark Knight returns to rise above even a lot of games that come out today, Batman: Arkham Knight sees the trilogy off with a bang and is well worth your time.",

          "content": "6,5/10\nDon\u2019t be scared by the screenshots, essentially this is a 3D walking sim with the ability to examine very detailed models, but for the most part there is no point in it, other than reading a huge number of notes and other things, no \u201cpixel hunting\u201d or looking for a box somewhere under the sofa, not even a sit button,\n\nIn 2D only our hands (which is ok), and conversations with our mother, which is already \u201cdoubtful, but ok\u201d, essentially like in the novel, the characters do not have lip movements when speaking, , the characters do not have lip movements when speaking, but there are animations of gestures and emotions, but they are repeated too often, the main character is pleasant, but I couldn\u2019t really get into it due to the lack of animations, the story itself is cute, but the banal \u201ceveryday humdrum\u201d: t to whom the grandmother cheated or she did not cheat, who is the real father in that spirit, there is an opportunity to speed up replicas, but then the game will take about 2 hours to complete, with all the secrets in about 3 hours.\nMusic/Ambient is so quiet that it\u2019s even depressing, some items can be taken with you and they will appear somewhere in the glove compartment of the car, , there are a couple of optional dialogues with a friend on a push-button phone and a couple of dialogues depending on your presses, which may make you smile, the atmosphere of the trip is not even close to \"Road 96\", the game failed to create its own atmosphere at all, just a cute short novel with 3D scenery, alas, I expected more, I really love mixing styles and I like the \"Annapurna Interactive\" games, but lately they are not surprised.\n\nCheck my Annapurna Top:

O jogo permite voc\u00ea criar rela\u00e7\u00f5es sinceras entre os personagens, muito mais em especial com o seu parceiro Pok\u00e9mon Miraidon.\n\nO suspense est\u00e1 a todo vapor em Pok\u00e9mon Violet, v\u00e1rias vezes me peguei desconfiado de algu\u00e9m, ou intrigado com as a\u00e7\u00f5es dos outros, e embora algumas hist\u00f3rias se sobreponham em cima de outras, por puro interesse, eu queria e sabia que o desfecho delas seria realmente deslumbrante.\n\nAs complexidades dos mapas que a gamefreak cria s\u00e3o pontos que realmente me surpreenderam, e os biomas s\u00e3o muito bem conectados, voc\u00ea v\u00ea a transi\u00e7\u00e3o natural quando sai de uma \u00e1rea com muita lama para uma \u00e1rea mais verde, e v\u00ea os pok\u00e9mon vivendo de forma selvagem, o que \u00e9 uma adi\u00e7\u00e3o muito bonita e valiosa.\n\nDe antem\u00e3o, Pok\u00e9mon Violet tem SIM problemas de performance, como FPS e bugs chatos que afetam a jogabilidade, mas aqui vou tratar de gr\u00e1ficos e bugs gr\u00e1ficos, ou seja, o contexto visual da coisa. E com isso, garanto, Pok\u00e9mon teve um upgrade maravilhoso em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a Sword &amp; Shield.\n\nE para come\u00e7ar por eles, vamos falar dos Pok\u00e9mon. A maioria deles est\u00e3o bem polidos, trabalhados e traz fidelidade em seus comportamentos. Suas texturas tamb\u00e9m seguem sua biologia, no entanto, Pok\u00e9mon que n\u00e3o possuem pelos ou escamas \u00e0s vezes parecem ser feitos de pl\u00e1stico.\n\nA renderiza\u00e7\u00e3o no Nintendo Switch tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 algo que me preocupa bastante, pois al\u00e9m dos Pok\u00e9mon simplesmente aparecerem na sua tela, alguns aparecem com gr\u00e1ficos quadrados que com o tempo v\u00e3o se ajustando e tomando sua forma original, e isso \u00e9 algo que me tira momentaneamente da imers\u00e3o.\n\nQuando se trata da trilha sonora de Pok\u00e9mon, confesso que facilmente me empolgo. Nesse tema, o cuidado \u00e9 outro. Em Pok\u00e9mon Violet tudo tem seu pr\u00f3prio tema, e muitos deles s\u00e3o extremamente divertidos e com contexto, e embora n\u00e3o supere Sword &amp; Shield, v\u00e1rios temas s\u00e3o dignos de playlist.\n\nJ\u00e1 que a trilha sonora traz tanta emo\u00e7\u00e3o, por outro lado os efeitos sonoros s\u00e3o um recurso pecaminoso, j\u00e1 que os ataques dos Pok\u00e9mon s\u00e3o compostos por sons de explos\u00e3o e estrondos gen\u00e9ricos, e os menus s\u00e3o uma sinfonia barata cheia de \"Plims\" e \"Plams\". Apenas o som de \"check\" da Pok\u00e9bola salva nesse quesito.\n\nE por fim, a falta de dublagem, pelo menos em cenas \u00e9picas, \u00e9 um grande mist\u00e9rio para os jogos Pok\u00e9mon, e com Pok\u00e9mon Masters Ex j\u00e1 apresentando esse recurso, torna injustific\u00e1vel a falta de dublagem e voz dos personagens, e assim, \u00e9 s\u00e9rio que temos mais uma cena de m\u00fasica escrita em uma caixa de di\u00e1logo?\n\nO mundo aberto de Pok\u00e9mon de fato traz uma experi\u00eancia completamente nova e fascinante, voc\u00ea se distrai muito facilmente em suas explora\u00e7\u00f5es, e isso \u00e9 \u00f3timo, pois \u00e9 divertido explorar a regi\u00e3o de Paldea, s\u00e3o muitas descobertas atr\u00e1s de descobertas de um mundo completamente rico e lindo.\n\nQuem j\u00e1 jogou Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus sabe bem que jogar Pok\u00e9mon Violet \u00e9 praticamente voltar \u00e0 sua rotina de batalhas lentas e complexas, mas ainda com comandos de interface semelhantes. Para quem est\u00e1 vindo diretamente de Sword &amp; Shield, poder\u00e1 notar um grande avan\u00e7o na Qualidade de Vida do jogo.\n\nE bem diferente de seus antecessores, Pok\u00e9mon Violet finalmente separa jogadores competitivos de jogadores casuais e Shiny Hunts, o jogo prop\u00f5e desafios s\u00f3lidos para todos e voc\u00ea apenas escolhe como quer viver em Paldea, pois o jogo possui conte\u00fado para mais de 200 horas de jogabilidade casual.",

          "content": "You are sent to investigate a lonely roadside diner that has lost its color.  Your mission is to restore the colors by solving various puzzles while uncovering a mystery as to why the colors disappeared in the first place.  What is the mystery of Discolored?\n\nGood question.  I did not uncover any deeper secrets or discover why the colors disappeared in the first place.  This is frustrating as the About This Game section on the Storepage hinted at \u201cdiscovering deeper secrets\u201d and, sadly, Discolored didn\u2019t deliver.\n\nWhat is this game then?  Discolored is a surreal, beautifully crafted, and well-thought out \u2018Find and Solve\u2019 game that the developer obviously put his heart and soul into.  It is a good game but I would have liked to have learned more about the world: who I am, why I am finding colors of this strange diner, and what is going on.  Sadly, Discolored doesn\u2019t offer any clues (unless I totally missed them, which is possible).  Additionally, the beginning and end of Discolored were confusing for an already perplexing game story wise.\n\nDiscolored, overall, was interesting but I wasn\u2019t overly impressed with the game.  There are some great points, however.  Beautifully crafted visuals were simple in nature but good, the sound was on par with the game, the music was nice, the gameplay simple to pick up, and the puzzles were fine and made for an enjoyable, albeit short, game.  But in the end it was the lack of story, or explanation of the story, that made the game fall short in my opinion.\n\nWill there be a next chapter to Discolored?  Will it explain more about the world and you as the protagonist?  I hope so\u2026I really do.  I recommend Discolored for people who enjoy the \u2018Find and Solve\u2019 style games but would recommend that you get it on sale as the full price is a little steep for a one to two-hour game. ",

It has a bit of humor here and there and doesn't take itself too seriously. The reason you're going to play this game is the combat, and it is very enjoyable until the very end. Level design gets more and more absurd (in a good way) as you progress, keeping gameplay relatively fresh, along with new enemies that play differently. Only disappointment was that towards the end it took too long between checkpoints, adding to the difficulty because it allows zero mistakes for a long period, instead of actually difficult combat.",

          "content": "Going to play Gunbird 2 for nostalgic reasons; I was really surprised how beginner friendly this game can be. Like don't get me wrong, it has challenging issues, but the initial start of the game wasn't nearly as off putting as some other shmups out there. Gunbird 2 has a tendency to shift between it's first few stages giving players a chance to become more familiar with it's levels. The way that you lose power ups is gradual as it's not all at once, and the enemy attacks do have some predictable patterns once you get use to them. All in all, Gunbird 2 is at least friendly in the beginning, which makes for the last 2 levels spike in difficulty really exasperating.\n\nHonestly, I think that's just the main problem with Gunbird 2 here. No matter how much you pay attention it can always feel like a bomb didn't go off fast enough or an attack came out way too fast. And really this is only noticeable near the end of the game, at Gunbird 2's last two levels that things feel unfair. Why there is suddenly a laser that can instantly come out, or the way certain enemies and attack patterns start attacking from the sides really feels more jarring than challenging. No enemies are introduced before hand that are like this, and the game sort requires you know when a boss is just going to fire a laser with little warning. It just makes getting to the end point, only to game over feel awful, or simply dying in these last few levels a hellish nightmare of survival that feels like there is no way out.",

          "content": "Florence is an ephemeral, but utterly unforgettable visual novel/interactive story; an intimate portrait of a relationship where each chapter represents a stage in a couple's journey together. From those initial sparks of infatuation filled with giddy anxiety and anticipation, to arguments filled with angry outbursts and subsequent feelings of regret.\r\n\r\nEach of these snapshots is accompanied with simple, but smart gameplay elements that enhance and elevate rather than detract from the themes at play in each scene. For example, dialogue is represented as puzzle pieces throughout the course of the game; during the first date section, each dialogue bubble has 4-5 pieces, since the characters are still getting to know each other. Later on however, as the relationship develops, these puzzles become easier, with only 2 or 3 pieces per puzzle. It's such a brilliantly intuitive way to communicate such a complex idea, and the game is absolutely full of similarly magical moments just as this one.\r\n\r\nIf Florence has any shortcomings, it's that it's not particularly replayable; it doesn't have any secrets to uncover, and it doesn't have multiple endings to unlock, but what it lacks here, it makes up for in attention to detail. There are multiple points where you're able to add your own personal touches that will eventually weave their way into the background of the narrative, and it's things like that really make the game's emotional impact all the more stunning to experience.\r\n\r\nFlorence serves as a reminder that simplicity in game design doesn't automatically equate to a shallow experience, and it's a rare case amidst the visual novel genre where the gameplay is anything but vestigial in nature. It simply would not work as well as it does without that interactive element to the storytelling.\r\n\r\nA lovely, emotional, one of a kind masterpiece.\r\n10/10.",

Another flaw of the game for me is not very well-developed shooting, I completed game with a shotgun, it's much easier, but the \"aim-challenge\" is losted.\nWell, I can also say that sometimes quite beautiful locations are generated, all the sounds are of high quality.\nAnd yet, the game is quite easy, in fact, it takes 4-7 hours to complete, even if you don\u2019t know how to shoot (again, shotgun helps you), lacks some kind of hardcore mode, but it would be even better to get the second part)\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

In general, I do not recommend the original part,\n\nBut the sequel can already be recommended, well .. for a very specific audience. This is the same Goat simulator.. only normally designed, now we have Unreal engine graphics and physics, a pretty visual/interface, a more interesting location of the city in the mountains, for completing tasks you recieve new clothes for customizing your goat, there are activities for multiplayer, although very primitive, and you can drive cars) And even the control is nice. More or less normal optimization. And now.. I can\u2019t say that this is a bad and pointless game, but it\u2019s also not necessary to play it.. I liked more the 2021 game from some developers of Goat Simulator in the same genre of sandbox or \"entertain yourself\" - \"Just Die Already\" , there was an interesting city, at least a little lively, cartoonish visual, interesting secrets, at least some goal that could be called the final of game, the concept itself - when you play as a fragile grandfather and can \"dismember\" into pieces from any hit/touch - really created a unique \"sandbox\" experience, and it also gave you some kind of hardcore.\nBut in the \"Goat\" game, jumping on some skyscrapers, for the sake of secrets, on the contrary, infuriates, it's easier to just run around and smash everything around into chips with your horns, but it will quickly get boring. Interesting Easter eggs i also didn`t met, except for a simple mangling of famous names, but it's boring. The game itself is trying to parody games in the open world, but in fact it`s the same, if you call \"farm\" useless - That doesn't stop a farm from being a farm) It would be better if the game deep more seriously into some specific \"parody\", like it was in dlc to the original, well, or at least.. Would add more reactions to people). They also added full-fledged missions, like helping someone or doing something, but in terms of gameplay, this is all also implemented as primitively as possible.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 I only liked the joke at the end of the mini-game, when no matter who wins the round, you can be the first to reach the cup at the end and win). Yes, and the initial cutscene from the first person was made cool, I already thought that I was playing AAA about a goat, and, by the way, the price of the game, now, of course, is a very goaty.. in any region.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

          "content": "I can't believe I've not reviewed this...I think I was waiting to return to this game and get all the achievements. Something I only save for games that really inspire me to go 110% for them. I originally streamed this years ago and certainly didn't know what I was going to get with this!\nFirst part of my stream: https://youtu.be/-aDXAHywnFs?si=a_uAnfR1cIHKfxzY\n\nNow before continuing I'll get content warnings for this game out of the way for those that need them:\nSexual Abuse (referenced and suggestive imagery), gore (decapitations, blood, open wounds), body horror, Childhood Sexual Abuse (only written down and alluded to for first and DLC case) and that's all that comes to mind. I apologise if I missed any.\n\nWhen I started this game up my assumption was that it would be a horror visual novel similar to others I had played in the past, being fairly typical and \"middle of the road\" in regards to horror (as there's only so much you can do with a VN, right?) however this would prove to be one of those that, like The Letter, has a lot of depth to it and can be really haunting. Even if you're the type not easily scared by horror or gore.\nUnlike The Letter, this game doesn't have nearly as many branching paths, however, the choices in it were great and very fulfilling imo.\n\nStory:\n(It's been a while so bare with me...)\nYou play as someone who wakes up with amnesia and has a mysterious mark on your wrist. Soon you learn that it's a curse and when investigating a building that you feel a strange draw to and a clue about your curse you are greeted by a creepily human-like doll that's just sat there as if it were alive. The person you search for, turns out to be dead with flowers bursting from their stomach and before you can get any answers you meet a few strangers who were looking for the same person and needed help in their investigation of a haunted school.\nThe doll is actually alive and speaks to you about the curse, suggesting that they might be related somehow and you on on a adventure of tracking down these haunted locations and removing the spirits.\n\nGameplay:\nAs a VN you can imagine that there isn't too much here that you don't be expecting, that said, you are able to choose only one person to bring with you on these investigations and each one may give you a different insight or even have a skill to help with your investigation.\nWhen you have a final showdown with the spirit, you have a selection of items to use that, when used, will create a different reaction and depending on what you do, you may either banish the spirit (effectively destroying the spirit and sending it to oblivion) or help them pass on (pacifying the spirit's rage, releasing everyone from it's curse and helping it pass to the other side) which in some cases were easy if you paid attention to who this ghost was, what happened in their life and, ultimately, how they became what they are now.\n\nThis adds more of a story aspect than real mechanical benefit from what I remember, but either ending is up to how you feel in regards to these lonely spirits who often ultimately died in a painful way that they didn't deserve. There are also timed sections where you need to make a choice or end up dead. A life-or-death situation where the wrong move can cost you your life which happens either due to the spirit finding you first before you are ready, a trap being set off or even attacked by a vicious/possessed animal. Again, the solutions are there if you look for them, however, not everyone will be able to identify them or even understand the order they need to be used in, but the save system is fairly generous so it isn't too bad. Again if memory serves.\n\nThe art is perfect in it's ability to portray images that evoke horror and fear. I wasn't too certain of it at the beginning, but I found myself really liking it. It's certainly not your typical brightly-coloured anime style and there is a lack of typical emotes like sweat drips and ect, however, this all just adds to the game. I don't think I could've taken these moments are seriously as I did when playing this if the art looked like, say, Hero Academia or Spy X Family. If anything, this is closer to Attack on Titan with it's use on dark colours that convey the seriousness of the series.\n\nThis is a really good horror VN that took me completely by surprise! I highly recommend it, but only if you can stomach through the content warnings mentioned earlier. They don't pull their punches in the topics of this game and it's all the more reason to play it!",

          "content": "Traverse a decaying land filled with wonder and danger as you, Stela, witness the final days of a mysterious ancient world. Explore dark forests, cold snowfields, flammable battlefields, mysterious towns, and subterranean horrors as your race to your destination.\n\nStela is a side-scrolling cinematic puzzle platformer with an interesting and engaging story through the first and second act. By bypassing creatures, discovering secrets, and engaging in interesting puzzles you slowly begin to understand the world around you\u2014or at least the dangers of this strange and doomed world has to offer. This game is absolutely beautiful\u2014the artwork, music, and puzzles are great and make for a memorable gameplay experience. All of the different parts work very well together with the highlight in my opinion being the music and artwork.\n\nSadly, there seems to be no motive for the girl running and bypassing obstacles and things that want to kill her. The game doesn\u2019t offer this to us as there is no text and no speaking. This is, perhaps, why I came to the conclusion that Stela didn\u2019t give me any deep emotional connection to the story. Speaking of story, it is the last chapter that seemed to fall flat when it should have been the crescendo of the entire game, and I was left feeling confused about not only the backdrop of the last chapter but what I was really doing there as well. This makes it feel as if the game was more about the graphics and music instead of any real story.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn\u2014you run, you jump, and you can push some objects around. The achievements, for the most part, are easy to get as most of them are storyline achievements. There are only two achievements that are harder to get, finish the game without dying and finish the game in under 90 minutes, that will have you play the game multiple times.\n\nOverall, I found Stela to be a good game with amazing visuals, beautiful sound, and engaging puzzles with a hint of horror included. Despite it\u2019s flaws I would recommend this game for those interested in the beauty that can be applied to side-scrolling games, those that enjoyed LIMBO or Little Nightmares, or those that enjoy puzzle platformers in a strange and mysterious world filled with danger and beautiful landscapes.",

          "content": "RECENSIONE (ITALIAN):\n\u00c8 un buon gioco ma estremamente derivativo, senza grossi errori ma che non raggiunge i picchi di qualit\u00e0 dei diretti rivali, uno su tutto Inside.\n\nAUDIO E GRAFICA:\nIl comparto audio \u00e8 quasi assente, c'\u00e8 una buona colonna sonora e qualche altro suono, ma utili solo per non lasciare il gioco muto, niente di memorabile.\n\nMolto curata invece la grafica del gioco che, come Inside, propone uno stile low poly a scorrimento orizzontale ma in un ambiente 3D.\nIl difetto principale sta nel fatto che ogni tanto \u00e8 possibile interagire con oggetti pi\u00f9 lontani o vicini di noi, ma la profondit\u00e0 non \u00e8 abbastanza chiara e a volte si commettono errori pensando di poter saltare su qualche elemento oppure non scalandone altri.\n\nBuone ma inferiori al titolo Playdead sono le animazioni, abbastanza ricche e dettagliate ma non molto fluide.\n\nMolto bella infine la gestione della camera, che si muove molto per creare inquadrature spesso evocative. Questo a volte inficia la visibilit\u00e0 della protagonista, ma in realt\u00e0 la situazione rimane sempre sotto controllo. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nCome gi\u00e0 detto il gioco \u00e8 di base molto simile ad altri titoli. Si sviluppa a scorrimento orizzontale ma senza molte sezioni platform e soprattutto l'ambiente \u00e8 tridimensionale, quindi dovremo stare attenti anche agli elementi sullo sfondo.\n\nI soli comandi di salto e presa bastano per creare abbastanza situazioni interessanti lungo l'intero sviluppo del gioco, lungo circa 3 ore.\n\nGli enigmi ambientali sono difficili il giusto da capire, ma alcuni sono piuttosto ostici da realizzare per colpa dei nemici. \n\nSono inoltre presenti diversi segreti, molto ben nascosti in quanto il primo l'ho trovato solo a gioco inoltrato (mi stavo chiedendo come mai non ci fossero segreti, visto che sono frequenti in questo genere).\n\nSTORIA:\nIl gioco non ha una vera e propria storia, cosa che in questo genere si pu\u00f2 accettare, per\u00f2 i cambi di ambientazione sono completamente illogici e atti solo a permettere certe situazioni.\n\nNon ho apprezzato come il gioco sembra voler trasmettere un messaggio, a me ignoto, ma fallisca nel farlo e per provare a farlo rovini anche la coerenza delle ambientazioni.\n\nDevo dire per\u00f2 che ogni singola ambientazione \u00e8 pensata molto bene, con vari elementi e nemici specifici, tutto molto diversi e abbastanza originali.\n\n\nIn conclusione, consiglio il gioco agli amanti del genere perch\u00e9 dura poco ed \u00e8 piacevole, ma una volta provato Inside si capiscono tutti i limiti di Stela.\n\nVOTO: 7.5/10",

          "content": "Somewhere in the dev office when this game idea was pitched : Yo dude, how about we make a game about fantasy world without even trying to mesh the game character in 3D with open-world illusion and leave it with polygon shape as art direction style to make a difference than similar game, add elementary school puzzle tier with long backtracking plus make our main character can travel around the world by shape-shifting into a bird while the music consist of sleepy ambient and half-baked chillwave music being played randomly, meanwhile we dont really have too much assets for many characters and care enough about the world building story by putting the main character should save the world because her ancestor did something wrong. Also, dont put any combat, score, item collecting. And make our game as walking and flying simulator.\r\n\r\nAnd that is shortest summary of the game I played that consumes 3 hours for a game that you can play before sleep to experience the greatness of yawning I have got from this game. A potential great indie game but ruined with just simple walking and flying simulator in fantasy world that reminds me of 3D Legend of Zelda game where main objective to finish all floating island in the sky that is pretty cool concept but there are not many things to do after reaching the island except solving the basic puzzle to reveal the plotline about how dark creature will take over the world except main character visiting all the shrine and got the power. The lame thing about getting the power that there is no power at all to use in combat because there is no enemy to face except in the cut scene for each completing puzzle. \r\n\r\nI think it\u2019s not fair though to judge an indie game having combat element and its become full player exploration experience, but the thing game don\u2019t give too much instruction what to do or simple quest tracker is pretty off. There countable NPC in your base that gives the clue what to visit but considering this game is meant to play as chilling session, I end up wandering back and forth and almost made me quit. \r\n\r\nRating : 5/10\r\nFinished : 22 December 2019\r\nWritten : 20 January 2020\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

The way the colours pop and are so striking to look at it, its shame that there's no photo mode, as me and my friend just wanted to take as many screenshots as we could! The cutscenes are also decently animated and more then what I was expecting from an indie title.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is very much like Dishonored with a similar teleporting ability and other powers to what you would find in an Arkane game. Some of my favourites were the dagger throwing ability and one that allows you to blind opponents so you can sneak past or run up for a kill. The gameplay just felt very smooth overall for me. The levels are mostly linear but there a couple of more open areas which really let you explore and take out the army of guards in anyway you see fit. Not as large and explorable as a Arkane level, but close enough. And all of this just works perfectly in co-op!\r\n\r\nThe bosses are also a stand out. There are only a few of them with one reminding me of the Mr. Freeze boss fight from Batman: Arkham City in the best way possible! The final boss worked very well in terms of the story, but is a little simple as far as boss design goes.\r\n\r\nAs for the story, I was expecting something pretty basic going in, and what I got wasn't anything mind blowing but was still pretty solid and left me satisfied with the experience!",

The game should have been able to scratch this itch considering it has no competitive online modes. However, it doesn\u2019t fully accomplishes this.

But the overall amazing game and the very deep story are killed by very bad controls, especially if you're on PC without a controller. It doesn't have any character development, no skill tree, anything that would make your travels easier the more you try. So you can get into situations where you don't feel any progress at all, just redoing the same thing over and over, diving into depths of helplessness. This is especially painful in locations such as Sun Station or going around the fish. As long as there's forced minutes long wait time between each try, you can get into a situation where you've been trying for hours staring at the screen, waiting, doing the same thing, then failing again. This is not enjoyable at all, considering you can't even alt-tab to the windows while waiting for scripted events, the window has to be active. This is one of the games that are better to be seen as a story video, playing it is not so fun.",

On each launch of your spaceship, you\u2019re going to die. Even if you pilot your ship accurately and don\u2019t fall into a crevasse or run out of oxygen, the sun is going to go supernova. And you\u2019re gonna die. \n\nBut you remember everything when you come back, although your home planet friends don\u2019t notice. \n\nThis loop is the primary hook to Outer Wilds. There\u2019s no saving, except between loops. \n\nThe loops, so far, can be quite fun and the game doesn\u2019t drag out setting up the mystery. It can be a bit tedious doing the takeoff routine and heading back the planet or moon you were last on. You have an autopilot,  but it might steer you into an asteroid on the way. \n\nOn day one of its release, I\u2019m going to call it a good game. If it turns out to be a great game, I\u2019ll say so.

Completing it felt more like a chore than an adventure, but I'm aware I am a very anxious person, and that might have compromised my enjoyment. The amount of backtracking and hours invested in aimless exploration (not knowing what to look for or how to solve a puzzle - or even knowing there is a puzzle to solve) will really test your patience. The ambientation compensates this frustration with amazing soundtrack, a spectacle of visuals and a endearing mystery. Nonetheless, even if you are like me, and quickly gets frustrated, I think this game is worth trying. You will find something here no other game has to offer. For that reason alone, Outer Wilds is worthy of all praises.",

          "content": "Enter a strange world full of puzzles, disturbing visuals, and oddness as you take part in four experimental chapters that explore 80\u2019s nostalgia, horror elements, and intensive puzzles.  Take part in Stories Untold to uncover the truth, the dread, and the mystery of four different stories intertwined into one game.\n\nStories Untold is an anthology of four chapters that, while different from each other, are brought together in the final chapter for a conclusion that creates cohesion out of the different parts of the whole.  Stories Untold focuses on text-based adventure/horror  games and point-and-click to solve puzzles.  When the puzzle is completed the game progresses the slowly unfolding story along.\n\nI appreciated the collection of stories and was pleased with the connections made in the final chapter\u2014something that anthologies, especially horror anthologies, usually have a hard time doing.  The addition of very meta parts in the fourth and final chapter made it fun.  However, the problem with Stories Untold is that while the four chapters are well crafted and tied together nicely; the story itself is quite tame. The story was good, a bit predictable, but okay.  It didn\u2019t have anything clever or unique or subversive beyond the final \u201ctwist\u201d and left the overall experience of Stories Untold with a story that wasn\u2019t very memorable.\n\nWhile a good game; Stories Untold is not perfect.  The text-based portions were not \u201cmind bending\u201d nor were they thoroughly enjoyable (perhaps touching on 80\u2019s games a bit too much).  Stories Untold tends to lean too much on the 80\u2019s nostalgia especially with the equally ancient text parser\u2026the game was released in 2017 and I am sure there was better parsers available to use.  This issue makes me feel that the nostalgia theme of the game was used more as a crutch than a style design.\n\nAs an important note:  If you are hard of hearing you will have difficulty with Chapter Three.  Being able to hear the numbers and codes given over the radio was especially difficult.  Even with subtitles on they will not display the numbers as text.  I do not expect the game to subtitle the codes and numbers but felt that others with a hearing disability should know about this beforehand.  Additionally, there is an epilepsy warning on this game which you should take seriously if this is something that will affect you.\n\nOverall, an okay game that has no replayability besides getting the hidden achievements.  While I did like some of the elements of Stories Untold there were parts that were not enjoyable.  I will still recommend this game however, if mostly for the horror elements over gameplay\u2026extra points for getting it on sale.",

The game has four individual stories in which you interact with 80s technology (old computers, scientific equipment etc) in scifi horror stories. Theyre very SCP style horror stories which arent really trying to make you jump, more give you that sense of dread from experiencing something unnatural.

They added a few mechanics mostly relating to bat-tech which make you feel pretty bat-like. \nI just wish I'd had more chances to fight from the shadows rather than get in open fist/firefights. \nThe main problem was that its the same engine telltale use for everything. The models and scenery look great but animations are stilted and I dropped frames a fair bit. Also theres not challenge in it.

          "content": "This game has everything to be great -- a sardonic plot with an extremely likeable main character, a very twisted sense of humor, and puzzles which are quite hard and original in their design. Even Sir Patrick Stewart lends his voice to the narration.\n\nBut somehow, it feels grindy. While the puzzles are somewhat original, you see almost all their mechanics in the first few levels. And then most of them consist in moving barrels step by step across the environments to create shadows, which isn't that much fun. And then if you really want to get all \"stars\", you have to redo the level but now without making mistakes, and very fast and efficiently. It does not help that the interface is quite fiddly and you often end up clicking in the wrong places (by the way, mouse was much better than a controller for me).\n\nBut I am being too harsh -- on the other hand, the game has an in-game hint system which I did use for the last harder puzzles. And some of them are very clever -- many times I had the \"this is impossible!\" feeling, only to have that \"a-ha!\" moment later when figuring out what could be done.\n\nAnyway, it was an interesting game, it just should flow better (though honestly I do not know how this could be done with this game concept).\n\nScore: 62/100.",

          "content": "To start with the positives, the movement is improved as your character feels much better to control. Also you can knock out enemies and not just be forced to kill them which is great for a passive run. I also like that you can select classic mode as a difficulty which is more akin to the first game where you can't really be spotted by guards as its a one hit kill if they catch you.\r\n\r\nThat's sadly it for my positives. This game while not a live service has the stink of that genre all over it, from the terribly designed Destiny like UI with that stupid mouse cursor like interface (thats always terrible to use with a controller), the home base where you accept missions, has that MMO like feeling with the way you interact with NPCs and just the very multiplayer focus of this game. While the first game had co-op it was done in a fun drop in, drop out sort of way which is my preferred style. This game just has that more live service multiplayer feel and I don't think it served this title that is a mostly stealth game. They also added in combat so you can take on enemies directly but I didn't really like the feel of this at all and like I said classic mode makes this mute anyway.\r\n\r\nOtherwise they introduce cosmetics in this game rather then just having the skins you unlock after completing challenges like in the first game. The cosmetics just look awful imo and don't make sense in the context of the game. Much of them are these very bulky looking armours which I'm just like why would I wear that if I'm supposed to be a ninja assassin? The game's artstyle is also a bit of a departure from the first game which was made on unity like this one, but it had that cool water color, cell shaded artstyle that still looks very visually striking today. In this game it just looks like a generic unity engine game, with some of the artstyle retained, but characters just look unfinished and rough looking especially your main character. Its like if the first title was a cool looking PS2 game, this is an early, ugly looking PS3 game where they didn't know how to take advantage of the hardware properly.\r\n\r\nThe story also just fell flat for me and it plays into the Destiny style presentation that I touched on earlier. It just doesn't work for me. I bought this game to play in co-op with my buddy as him and I both love stealth games, but even that wasn't enough to save this one for me. It's a shame the devs had to close their doors as they could have made some great future games, but the direction they chose for this title is just disappointing.",

          "content": "STALKER: Shadow of Chernobyl is loosely based on the film \u201cSTALKER\u201d and the novel \u201cRoadside Picnic\u201d. The only things it shares with them are the anomalous artefacts, the existence of an exclusion zone and a dreary atmosphere.  There is no point in beating around the bush, STALKER: SoC isn\u2019t an uplifting or forgiving. Technically it's survival action, but looking back, I could classify this as survival horror with the number of times I thought to myself \u2013 I do not want to be here any longer. Don\u2019t take that as a negative, after finishing this game, I couldn\u2019t wait to play the rest of the trilogy. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a punishing open world action game set in a kind of post-apocalyptic environment with great atmosphere. Also, it\u2019s made by Ukrainians, so don\u2019t expect the best English voice acting.\n\nStory\nAs the title implies it's set in the Chernobyl exclusion zone where a totally different disaster from the one, we know happened. It caused reality altering anomalies to appear, mutant to start roaming the surface and horrors to lurk in the shadows. Many go there, against the government's wishes, seeking riches or salvation via the rumoured wish granter located at the power plant. \nThe character you play as is an enigma. He was brought back from the centre, remembers nothing, and his main objective is to kill some guy named Sterelok. It\u2019s not the best storyline I\u2019ve played, but it was enough to keep me engaged.\nObviously, that\u2019s not the only thing you can do. There aren\u2019t as many activities as some other games of the genre, but still there are interesting things to do and explore.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nSurvival horror, FPS, open world, are all genres STALKER SoC is a part of. I am going to be honest, most of it is kind of meh. Shooting is okay, but it\u2019s clearly outdated. The open world isn\u2019t bad, but it\u2019s the one you can go through twice before it starts feeling small. Artifact hunting is fun, but it\u2019s done so much better in later titles. Gameplay wise, there isn\u2019t anything I can point to specifically and say that it was done exceptionally well. But still I had fun and it being semi short it didn\u2019t get boring or annoying.\nI have heard some complaints about bugs and glitches, but I never had much of a problem with them.\n\nGraphics and artstyle\nThis is where STALKER: SoC can turn off a lot of people. A 2006 game made in Eastern Europe doesn\u2019t scream high quality. However, anyone who has got used to the low quality of the early 2000s won\u2019t find SoC off-putting. It at least never breaks the atmosphere it tries to build.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion  \nBy far the best part of STALKER is its dreary, suffocating atmosphere. Everything from the environment, the colour pallet, the around design is made to build it up. It\u2019s so well-crafted that I can totally see this world as existing on its own. I was totally immersed to the point where I was looking at random NPC\u2019s and wondering why are they here, could the zone really be a better alternative to the normal world.  \n\nSoundtrack\nAll the STALKER games share has similar soundtrack, so you might hear one ost in two or even their games. In any case, it's almost exclusivity dark ambience, so you would need a keen ear to memorize them. My favourite part is \u201cDirge For The Planet\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts \nI SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE I SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE I SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE I SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE I SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE I SAID COME IN DON\u2019T STAND THERE\n",

          "content": "Owlboy is by far the strangest game I have ever played. It's stunningly beautiful but seems unsure of its own identity. You come in expecting to play an adventure and platformer, only to find a dual-stick beat'em up with metroidvania elements that incorporates stealth phases. The most surprising aspect is that it's hard for me not to recommend it because it excels in the most unexpected genre: puzzles. In Owlboy, every confrontation and problem-solving task is logically achieved by leveraging your abilities and positioning. The story is decent, with a very satisfying climax, but it's odd that it leaves you wanting to play more. The difficulty balance is nonsensical: enemies kill you in 3 hits, but you have a checkpoint every 3 seconds. If you can overlook its shortcomings, the brilliant moments it offers are worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\nStunning Art and Animation: Owlboy's pixel art is exceptional, standing out in both static illustrations and animations. The game provides a visually stunning experience that captivates from the start menu.\r\nSimple and Effective Controls: Despite spanning various genres, the control of the character Otus is superb, especially in flight, dash, and parry. The sense of responsibility for failures contributes to the positive experience.\r\nFocus on Puzzles: While covering multiple genres, Owlboy excels in puzzle-solving, with these moments being highlights in the game. Logic and the use of abilities and positioning are crucial to overcoming challenges.\r\nEpic Boss Fights and Hordes: Boss battles and hordes offer intense action and follow a style similar to The Legend of Zelda. The patterns aren't complex, but strategy is key.\r\nAppropriate Soundtrack: The soundtrack appropriately accompanies exploration, reflecting the adventurous spirit of the game.\r\n\r\nWorst:\r\nLack of Genre Direction: Owlboy spans multiple genres (metroidvania, adventure, platformer, dual-sticker, stealth) but fails to fully excel in any. While puzzles are strong, the lack of focus may confuse the game's identity.\r\nUnengaging Narrative: The story and characters may not be captivating enough for some players. Despite a notable ending, achieving emotional connection can be challenging.\r\nAmbiguous Difficulty: Owlboy presents contradictory difficulty. While enemies are tough, the generosity of auto-save points diminishes the challenge. It's challenging to recommend to those seeking either a challenging experience or a more relaxed adventure.\r\nPC Configuration Issues: In the PC version, key layout can be problematic, especially with the combination of parry and shoot on the same button. Using a gamepad or adjusting the configuration is recommended.",

          "content": "Undertale is probably the game that most people think of when somebody says \"Indie Game\". And that's for good reason. There's a ton to love about Undertale, and my gripes are few and far between.\n\nFirst of all, the narrative is told pretty well. The story delivered here is very intriguing and thoughtful. The characters, especially, shine in Undertale. Everyone you meet is an interesting and dynamic character that has their own personality, wants, and thought. You find yourself sympathizing with almost every enemy, and the game does a great job of making you question why you are even fighting them.\n\nThe game also gives you a real sense of consequence to your actions. Every victory is very drawn out, really trying to show the world from the monsters' point of view.\n\nIt would also be remiss of me to mention the incredible soundtrack. I cannot stress enough how great the music in this game is. There's so many unique sounds and tunes that it really does an incredible job of pulling you into the game. I found myself just stopping to listen to the music whenever a new track started playing.\n\nBack to the mechanics, though. Movement around the world feels very retro, in a good way. Until you reach the later portions, this game really could have been pulled right from the 90s. This has good and bad aspects, with the most obvious drawback being how linear the world feels. The fighting mechanics are unique and fun. Every boss and enemy has its own fighting pattern and the game is constantly introducing new mechanics to the combat to keep it fresh.\n\nWith all that being said, I think the place where Undertale has some issues is with how the endings work. There are three major endings, and the game really encourages you to play all three to get the full story. Just finishing it once made me feel like I was missing a lot of interesting stuff. I wouldn't have a problem with encouraging you to play all three endings if it weren't for how much dialogue this game has. Having to click through hundreds of lines that I've already read doesn't sound very appealing. Unless you are going for a specific ending, there isn't a whole lot of replayability.\n\nOverall, though, Undertale is a very thoughtful, interesting, and humorous indie game that has definitely earned all the recognition that it has received.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10",

          "content": "Even worse than Amnesia 1 and 3\n\nThe gameplay is sluggishly painful and yields little to none involvement at times, your goal is to go to point A to point B and solve scarcely interlaced puzzles. In A Machine for Pigs, you backtrack for an item, bring it to something you interact with, then move on.\n\nNot to mention, the 'threat' in this game is VERY underwhelming. Not once in this game did I feel pressured or concerned about the Pigmen that roam the maps. The pigs themselves (with how few there are in the game) have dumb as heck AI, and are easily bypassable. You'll see one roaming a small corridor on one point, then never appear for the rest of the ten minutes while you sluggishly march to the next area. There's no sanity to manage, no lantern oil meter to cope with, and the damage the enemies deal is pathetic, it's something like seven hits for you to die to the standard pigs. \n\nThe game also bombards you with visionary blurs and flashbacks which became extremely monotonous and felt like their intention was to slow the pace of the game down for you to 'soak in the atmosphere'. The flashbacks in this game are usually so bland and hardly explore much detail into which was going on. I didn't really understand much at all about the main plot even given the notes I had to find dotted around the map. The main character just ended up talking about his children for the majority of the game (and I get that's one of the main points of the plot) but they could've at least explored some other parts, instead of leaving the plot focused on a single point for a while.\n\nThere's also a few occurrences that cause the game to hitch and lag badly in some areas. Something my PC should definitely be able to run smoothly, but it's thrown around into a choppy mess. Takes away from the actual 'gameplay' and makes it more of a slog than usual.",

          "content": "Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, developed by The Chinese Room and published by Frictional Games, is a chilling and atmospheric horror game that serves as a spiritual successor to the critically acclaimed Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Set in the Victorian era, this psychological horror adventure is a haunting descent into madness that will leave players on edge throughout their harrowing journey.\n\nThe game excels in creating an eerie atmosphere that permeates every corner of its world. From the hauntingly dark environments to the hauntingly melancholic soundtrack, A Machine for Pigs masterfully sets the stage for a nerve-wracking experience. The sound design, in particular, plays a crucial role in building tension, with subtle audio cues heightening the sense of dread as players navigate the twisted narrative.\n\nThe story, though cryptic and surreal, is captivating and well-written. As players assume the role of Oswald Mandus, an industrialist tormented by feverish dreams, they embark on a quest to uncover the dark secrets lurking within his own mind and the mysterious machine he has constructed. The narrative is intricately woven, unveiling layers of psychological horror that delve deep into themes of industrialism, morality, and the consequences of unchecked ambition.\n\nA Machine for Pigs incorporates more narrative-driven gameplay compared to its predecessor. While some players may appreciate the increased focus on storytelling, others may find it lacking in traditional survival horror mechanics, such as limited resources and intense moments of hiding from enemies. Nonetheless, the game's focus on psychological horror and its unsettling exploration of the human psyche make it a unique and thought-provoking experience.\n\nVisually, the game delivers a grim and gloomy world that is both beautiful and horrifying. The dark and grimy environments, coupled with the hauntingly grotesque designs of the machine's creations, instill a constant sense of dread and unease.\n\nHowever, the game's lack of challenging puzzles and occasional linearity may leave some players yearning for more engaging gameplay mechanics. Additionally, the limited interactions with the environment might diminish the overall immersion for players seeking more interactivity in their horror experience.\n\nIn summary, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs is a haunting psychological horror game that stands apart from its predecessor with a focus on storytelling and atmospheric immersion. While it may not cater to players seeking intense survival horror mechanics, its evocative narrative, chilling ambiance, and nightmarish themes make it a worthy addition to the Amnesia franchise. Fans of psychological horror should not miss the opportunity to venture into the unsettling depths of A Machine for Pigs.",

Its a very short game, but its a tightly made game and doesnt really repeat much. The puzzling isnt super hard, in fact it was quite intuitive.

It's a short but sweet game that absolutely nails everything it sets out to do. The stylized visuals are great and make the game stand out from other similar shooters. The story is also told in a very fun and engaging way. There's a narrator telling a story, and you're basically playing through what he's narrating. Sometimes the narrator makes a mistake or remembers something incorrectly, and the world changes around you to reflect that change in the story. The plot itself is also very interesting. Your character is essentially a Forest Gump of the West who ends up meeting all sorts of legendary gunslingers and even participating in crucial events in the history of these characters.\r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, the game is a 10/10. The shooting mechanics are flawless, with every action having clear and satisfying feedback through visual or audio effects. There's a decent variety of weapons you can use, the action is fast-paced, and the slow-motion ability just makes everything better. The game handles \"boss fights\" with a standoff minigame, where the player has to juggle hand movements and a speed meter in order to be able to draw faster than the opponent when the time comes. While not as exciting as the regular run-and-gun gameplay, it is way better than the classic \"enemy with an extra large health bar\" approach.",

Between runs, the player explores the cottage, manipulates objects and solves puzzles. There's nothing quite like Inscryption, it's completely unique and insanely polished. 10/10, a masterpiece. Nothing else happens in this game................................................................or so I wish. After you beat a run once (long before the game explored all of its potential), the concept of this ingenious gameplay loop is completely discarded. In its place follow two more acts which not only move on from, but recontextualize the first one. Act 2 is way too easy. Act 3 is a tedious copy of Act 1 without any stakes. As a whole, Inscryption is framed by a meta-narrative, sometimes told through live-action videos with very little creative quality, but a certain Youtube-2010-amateur-charm. Inscryption is bold, experimental and unique...but not always good.\r\n",

Even if there wasn't much actual story branching, you at least felt like you were a part of a living world and actually influencing it. Clementine drove those stories, and you really felt connected to the people in them because of her. A New Frontier throws you into the middle of a family you don't know or care about with obnoxious characters, all of which are not tortured or conflicted like in the first two games, but rather just assholes, irresponsible, or cocky jerks. There's no one to relate to, and Clementine is barely in the picture. Every time you start to want to get into the story and advance you're thrown into a crappy flashback with no bearing on what's happening. Then there are the sequences that are \"it's time to press X now, we'll wait\". Literally no other option. Just. Press. X. Ugh. \n\nDo yourself a favor and play the first two seasons (they're great), but avoid this one like the plague.",

I didn't feel my choices represented what I wanted to convey by the choice, and the lack of clarity made me make some decisions I did not want to make. Some would argue that's like real life, though, so it seems like a choice by the creators. The story is very much standalone, Clementine is a side character in this one, but her story is intertwined with the main narrative. The characters are not as likeable as in the previous installments, their fates mattered less to me than ever before. However, all this criticism stems from the expectations set by the first 2 games, and other Telltale games. The Walking Dead: A New Frontier is still a really good game which made me excited for the final installment, and is probably a necessary side step in an already legendary franchise.",

And you WILL need this army, because the game is not a walk in the park. It's not as hard as Sekiro, but several bosses will need more than 1 try to beat.\r\nThe exploration is also really fun, since Lily unlocks a lot of traversal skills along the journey to help her reach even the most unorthodox path she can find.\r\nStory-wise it takes a lot of inspiration from Souls, telling it's tale by the environment and journal entries, and also from item descriptions. And the stoy of it's kingdom is such a tragedy that will definitely make you wanting more.",

You can also hear the breakdown of your ship as it continues to fall apart under the pressure of the Blood Ocean.\n\nGrimy feelings, blurry images, clunky buttons - this all will make you feel like you're in your last rusty death coffin.\n\nIt's a short and unique experience, game about 70 minutes long, depending on how fast you will navigate your submarine.\n\nFor me it was kinda interesting, but I don't feel like it's a really very good game.\nBut many people think about this game as a masterpiece.",

          "content": "I rarely play horror games, mainly because most aren\u2019t that scary. IRON LUNG was a welcome exception. Even thought it's just an hour long and has very simple gameplay, I found it very enjoyable. I would recommend it if you want a short and sweet horror experience.\nStory\nIn the future, all planets and star mysteriously disappear. The only things left are space stations, asteroids and moon. Some of these moons have a very peculiar feature \u2013 blood oceans. You are a convict put in a tiny submarine that is of questionable quality and tasked with exploring these blood oceans. There is some more lore in a terminal in the sub, but other than that, there isn\u2019t any storyline that takes place during the game. \nMechanics and gameplay\nGameplay wise, it's very simplistic. You have a map with coordinates where you have to go. After reaching the given location, you have to take a picture. Moving the sub is just four buttons \u2013 forwards and backward, left or right.\nGraphics and artstyle\nIt uses minimalistic, low poly graphics that work very well for such a horror game. The pictures from the camera are very grainy and slightly distorted, making them feel realistic even in this kind of game.\nAtmosphere \nIRON LUNG is all about atmosphere and building tension. It shows the player more and more unnerving images, making them question whether they are truly alone. Also, by having the sub start to slowly break down combined with the note, it gives the feeling that no matter what you are not making back home.\nSoundtrack and sound effects\nSFX are incredible. Hearing something move from left to right makes you freeze up. The ost is mainly ambiance that adds to the tension.\nFinal Thoughts\nMe playing this game has nothing to do with recent events.\n",

          "content": "Across the Grooves is an excellent game for anyone who wants, or needs, to be reminded of the infinite possibilities of an eternal present.\n\nAcross the Grooves takes us through Alice's story and alongside her we discover how much magic there can be in life by exploring the mundanity of her life and her relationships.\nFor this, we, the players, make our first trip back in time by being exposed to numerous musical references, with the right to direct recommendations made by our \"game dictionary\", the Lexicon.\nThe rest... Well, the rest is history and I have no intention of telling.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Across the Grooves is almost a visual novel like any other. Its biggest highlight is, undeniably, the way the game uses music as a narrative engine linked to the gameplay. It's sparse but well-used, and for me, it's one of the most interesting things about the game.\nSmall choices abound here and the game's 8 different endings won't let me lie.\nWhether the endings are good or bad depends solely on how the player wants to interpret them.\n\nThe music recommendations and soundtrack of the game are excellent and very well complemented by the beautiful artistic direction.\n\nThe only caveat, unfortunately, is in the way the game decides to handle its progress.\nAfter 4 chapters engaging with the characters and their stories, the game decides it's time to throw a plot-twist and a huge exposition dump into the players' laps.\nAn unfortunate choice, in my opinion, but one that doesn't stop the game from closing in the 6 chapters it promises us.\n\nFinishing Across the Grooves left me wanting to go back and try again, to see every change, to see a new world build before my eyes.\nIt's certainly a journey worth cherishing, just as this game deserves to be cherished.",

There is a wide range of enemies spread on a big open world map. \nOne of my main problems with the game is the glitches.

          "content": "The story has you play as a shark, who's mother is killed by a shark hunter, which puts you on the path of revenge. The story is pretty basic, but good enough to keep you going and I liked the reality TV/documentary style they told the story through. It also helps that this game is narrated by Chris Parnell who voices Jerry on Rick and Morty! He adds a lot of funny quips and he definitely made the game a lot more enjoyable for me!\r\n\r\nManeater builds on the concepts of Jaws: Unleashed, where you start as a baby shark, and have to evolve your shark eventually to a megalodon level shark, by eating everything you can and battling other apex predators! It also throws in RPG mechanics where you level your shark, and equip different evolutions (in place of typical gear) that buff your shark in different ways. I like that this game had a very Arcady nature to it, in that you can just cause so much mayhem and destruction. You even get an evolution that allows your shark to jump onto land, and eat people for an extended period of time. Its stuff like that just adds to the fun factor of this game! Music as well was also really good with my favorite track being the track that plays in the grotto, which is your sharks lair, where you can save, fast travel and upgrade your evolutions.\r\n\r\nI also just enjoyed that the map was small, being split into different zones. It made the world not feel bloated that so many other open world/RPG games can feel at times, and with it taking me only 16 hours to complete everything (though some I heard have done it a shorter time) it felt like a nice pallet cleanser, in between bigger games. There is also the infamy system which is basically like the wanted level system in Grand Theft Auto, where when you caused enough chaos, you get shark hunters after you, which are like this games police. This also unlocks special bounty hunter bosses for you to fight, however its pretty easy to beat them as all you have to do is pull them into the water and eat them, and they have no real defense against you. Its fun to fight them and easy to escape them which I like, since many of the more recent GTA games made it hard to escape the police, to the point of it not being fun anymore for me at least.\r\n\r\nCombat is fairly decent as you pretty much just have a bite attack and tail whip to knock enemies away. It would have been nice to have a lock on feature, specifically when going up against other apex predators. But at the end of the day, it didn't bug me so much to the point of the combat being frustrating or anything like that.\r\n\r\nSome negatives, the enemy A.I. can be a bit dumb at times, particularly with the shark hunters, but like I said earlier, I prefer it being easier to escape them and then come back later to cause more chaos. The game can also be a bit too easy at times, as I wish there were different difficulty modes to pick from, as there is only one default difficulty. While performance was smooth with no major bugs, there were some humans enemies that would float in mid air, doing T poses, as well as on glitch, where I would break open a grate to get into hidden areas, only the grate would stay in place and not let me progress. It happen to me a few times and I had to quit to the main menu and reload to fix it.",

The game has been in development for years so they just launched it too late.\n\nIt's a pretty fun metroidvania with a lot of influences of symphony of the night and order of ecclisia, sometimes making direct references that doesn't always work. It reminded me of bloodstained: ritual of the night but not fully resting on the creator's older titles. I liked the time system, going on the same environments but in different times. Although they could use it with more impact in some areas.\n\nThe story tries too hard to be serious, it has a nice touch of representativity although it feels a bit forced in some moments. One of the plot twists of the game almost dismantle the story because it doesn't add anything to it.\n\nThe game is short, and I'ts a good think because It manages to end almost at the perfect time as the fun in it. The game could use a few more bosses, less use of the time freezing mechanic and more enemy variety. Also, the progression system is kind of strange. In the beginning of the game, you get a few new powers and weapons but by the end of it, you get so many weapons that you just doesn't have time to use. It's a consequence of the leveling system, demotivating the player to change his weapons.\n\nIn my opinion, I'ts a game worth played made by new devs that put a lot of effort on it.\n",

The script was written by Ben Roberts, and he previously worked on writing scripts for games such as The Walking Dead: Our World. The music was composed by Daniel Pemberton, who also created soundtracks for films such as Ocean's 8 and The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\n\nRegarding the graphics, the game uses the Unreal Engine 4 engine, which allows for detailed and realistic representation of different gardening tools and environments. The overall quality of the game is quite good, although some players may find the gameplay experience a bit repetitive. \n\nIn summary, Lawn Mowing Simulator is a fun and relaxing game that offers a unique gardening simulation experience.",

          "content": "To start with what I enjoyed, I liked the addition of you having a party of characters as opposed to Slay the Spire's single hero combat system. It felt more like an RPG which has always been my favourite genre. You start with two characters and can recruit more as you go along, with you being able to eventually unlock more heroes to have at the start. I also like the equipment system and being able to equip your characters with different armour and weapon cards was very cool. And like Slay the Spire you can run into various different random events as you play which I liked as well.\r\n\r\nThe negatives really are just the game got tedious for me after a while with a lot of the runs starting to feel the same. There was also one specific boss that I could not for the life of me beat, no matter how many times I tried. The bosses you get per run are randomised and if I ran into that specific boss, it was basically a game over for me before the fight even started. I'm also not a big fan of the ruin and banish system in this game. Slay the Spire has its own similar system but I feel it was implemented better then in this game. At one point I was in a boss encounter in which I had already killed the boss and most of his minions expect for one. I could not kill the final minion because all of my attack cards had been either banished or ruined making it a situation where I just had to abandon the run and lose all the XP I had gathered. I think this was due to one of the heroes I had recruited secondary ability, which is on me for not understanding, but at the same time it just shows how broken some of this games mechanics can be at times. I also prefer Slay the Spire's approach to characters, as each of the heroes have their own special deck of cards, encouraging you to almost change your play style depending on who you pick. This game sort of has that with the equipment system and a few unique cards for each character, but it just didn't feel as satisfying to play and unlock everyone.",

Of course it's only right to place it here, where the story starts.\n\nAt heart this is a classic point and click adventure. A genre claimed to be dead, but getting \"ressurected\" from now and then by talanted indi-storytellers. This time it's Daedalic, a company of which I've never heard before (though they do seem to have several pretty critically acclaimed games out at this point, so it might be just my ignorance) with their take on humour, creativity and random fun. =)\nThis game reminds me of the Runaway series, witty and charming main protagonist goes through unlikely events during a trilogy growing up and becoming a bit better.\n\nActually, just play this game if you miss the point&click fun, you won't regret.\n\nPS. The ending somewhat... left me hanging. >_<",

          "content": "Madison is a terrible game. At first it looks good, but don't let that fool you. The gameplay mostly consists of solving bland, unoriginal and absurd puzzles. Besides being a boring chore, not a single puzzle fits with the narrative, consequently their completion feels detached and mechanical. (To give you an idea, one of the puzzles has you running back and forth around the house grabbing items one by one to put them in the necessary order - after you solved it, doing the extra leg work is a bore). Puzzles vary between mazes, locks, finding keys and taking pictures to open doors. Real original.\r\n\r\nThe limited inventory space is just an annoyance that has you running to the safe to store your items just so you can go back and grab the item it wasn't letting you before. It doesn't add anything to the experience aside from general annoyance.\r\n\r\nAnd the problems don't stop at the gameplay. The Camera controls are weird and every time you sprint (more like jog), the camera shakes uncontrollably up and down. It made me sick.\r\n\r\nThe story is a pastiche of horror clich\u00e9s. Nothing to be said about it. Maybe it's the least awful thing about this game, even though it doesn't add up to anything at the end.\r\n\r\nThe vibe of the game is creepy, but nothing new. It has a few cheap jumpscares, but no real threat. After a while it just feels annoying.",

Most of the graphics are far beyond minimalistic and going full steam ahead towards clip-art, animations are so short that they are almost indistinguishable, especially from the walking (or rather seizuring, from the looks of it) animation. And it crashes. A lot.\n\nHowever, this is not the main problem of the game by far. The main problem is difficult to name properly, but personally, I am leaning towards calling it lack of respect. Why can't you change language in-game? Because eff-you-thank-you-very-much-please-buy-our-next-game. Why does it crash oftenly and unpredictably? Selfsame reason. Why is there a poorly thought message for people with mental problem a bit beyond title screen? Same. This does not feel like it was done with true intent to do good. This feels like it was done with an intend of looking like intention to do good-ish. Kind of.\n\nOverall, this game is a good picture of everything that is wrong with modern game development, if not with IT in general. The recipe of disaster we have here is as follows: slap together some shit and sell it under the guise of do-goodiness, so that the potential buyers may feel bad about themselves if they don't buy it, poor edjits that they are.",

          "content": "Unavowed is a point'n click game that has a structure similar to mass effect, separated in missions. In each mission we choose 2 squad member to bring with us. Every member has a unique skill that will determine how we are going to solve some puzzles. For example, Eli is a fire mage that can set fire on things and acess a thing called fire dimension, so he can get documents that were burned. Or Mandana, a Jinn that knows when someone is lying and can't lie herself.\n\nThe game starts with your exorcism, asking you your background and your genre, which will determine some parts of the story and can add to replay value. You are then recruted to Unavowed in a quest to discover what the demon did with your body over a year that increased the supernatural events in New York City. The story looks simple in structure, but it was the game's purpose as It has some interesting twists and plays with some point'n click cliches.\n\nEach mission brings It's own story, which is also amazing as It starts simple but escalates in a bizarre way. It feels like you are playing a short story in this amazing universe. The game also has some really morally challenging choices, which is a nice thing nowadays where most of the games just bring the usual good and evil, even though 92% of the people who played mass effect went the paragon route.\n\nThe game was made to be played multiple times not because of the endings, but because of your different backtories and who you bring to the missions, which unlock new dialogues with the character cast and new interactions and puzzle solving.\n\nFor me, the positive points of this game are Its amazing universe, atmosphere and It's empathetic characters. The art is also great, evoking a really good noir feeling, even though the game doesn't go in the detective cliche of cynism, which is a good thing.\n\nThe negative points are the animations that are lacking and repeat a lot of the times and the engine is kind of clunky. Also, talking about the story, some Unavowed members are underdeveloped, unidimensional and some feels like only a trope, like the recovering alcool addiction.\n\nThe negative points, as I sa",

The idea is simple: You go through the same loop, finding the differences, and if you do, you go back, and keep going until you leave the endless loop.\r\n\r\nNow, the idea is fun and the whole concept of finding 'anomalies' is interesting, but I think this piece falls short of other 'discover anomalies' games in that you're moving through a fairly boring loop that you can complete in like, five minutes and there isn't a lot of variety to really push you for a second or third run. The 'anomalies' only appearing once until you complete them all is a neat idea, but about a fourth of them are really interesting, which does make sense, but the rest, which you'll see more often, just isn't particularly engaging, and overall, makes the game really... Dull, I suppose.\r\n\r\nAll in all, it's an interesting idea and the game is visually pretty neat, but I don't think it's a game that work for multiple playthroughs, even if it feels that's the intention.",

The sounds and colors suck you in in a very strong way and don't let you go. It gives you a weirdly unpleasing feeling. The hard nature of the game strengthens that feeling even more, and when you fight the first boss you really feel as tiny as you are in this huge universe the game represents. \n\nThe best summary I can think of would be: This is a horror rythm game.\n\nHugely recommend to play this game, it is worth it.",

          "content": "I am not that much into the \"crafting\" genre, but this was good. There is quite a bit of light combat (not that varied for one single run, but I found it fun anyway), tons of light side quests and many small worlds to explore. And you might want to dig to find some secrets.\n\nI did not get into the whole building aspect of the game, but if you do, you will probably have lots to do here. And I played solo -- this could be more fun with the right friends.\n\nA few annoyances:\n-- Inventory management should be a lot better (sorting options?) for a game with so many items you want to keep (hint: build chests!);\n-- Button placement was odd! In general, button placement should mirror the location they show up on screen... so, if there are two tab menus on the screen, I expect the top one to be LT and RT and the bottom one to be LB and RB, am I the only one whose brain is wired this way? Another example: a shop menu has me pressing \"X\" to sell, but the X button shows on the right side of the screen... why?\n-- The crafting interface could have been streamlined somehow; I accept this is a crafting game where you have to build items A and B to later combine them with C to finally get D, but I hate having to fight menus to get all of this done (especially when button placement is odd!).\n-- There should be an option to break down an item into components! There were a few times where I crafted the wrong items (button placement!), losing precious items, and I could not undo the operation... :(\n\nBut these are all minor -- as I said before, the main game loop was fun, you can feel the character progression (especially when you get better items), and the whole thing was charming (think Lego aesthetics).\n\nScore: 78/100.",

There's plenty of games where you can work together and/or compete against each other, but most characters in those are generally kept equal, or at least balanced. In Monster Hunter, any player can specialize in wildly different specialties, despite using similar weapons and armors.\n\nWhen the name of the game is hitting some giant lizard with your grug stick, you don\u2019t need to keep reinventing the wheel, but you can bring your friends and your well-done steaks along to the barbecue. Especially when everyone brought their Spider-man web-slingers and each lobby is packed with pets\n\nShare a pint of Tanzian ale as you chow down on some of our master chef\u2019s delicious berry safe dango, because a new game means new ways to get your ass carted back to the weenie teepee.",

          "content": "Having just finished it yesterday it's a top 10 MV for me. Besides great platforming and movement options you have backtracking to progress, non-linear progression, and various sequence breaking opportunities meaning, so exploration is rather satisfying. Combat is also more prominent, something that's more give or take for me as I think the prequel's approach suited the player character better and made you think differently about taking on enemies while also making you feel more vulnerable. But this game also creates that vibe in the beginning, the chases and in mouldwood in particular. And the bosses were also good, if somewhat few, with some challenging ones but the forgiving checkpoint system let it avoid the frustration of Hollow Knight (except for the chases ironically as they didn't have them and also killed you in one hit). I mention HK as it's an obvious inspiration for certain aspects such as the shard slot system and how healing works, though the game also borrows from games like Guacamelee and Sonic Colors. I mostly didn't mind as it's generally done well. \r\n\r\nI do wish the optional dark cave was more fleshed out, and maybe the sand area \"dungeon\" as well. Some other things could be tweaked like the seed rewards (mostly pointless to me), and being able to trade in unwanted shards for something else, among some other minor things like some shards working better as permanent abilities. I also liked having a teleporter beacon in the first, and being able to change difficulty on the fly, so those features were missed.\r\n\r\nI guess there could've also been an optional battle arena gauntlet like in Darksiders 2, for those who really wanted a combat challenge.\r\n\r\nIf you're into the sequence breaking aspect of MVs I would recommend looking up sentry jump/super jump and skipping buying the maps from the map maker, it makes the exploration (even) more satisfying. You can also get Launch early but that pretty much breaks the game.\r\n\r\n8/10 or 8.5/10 on a better PC and with all bugs fixed. Which is between great and amazing on my scale.",

          "content": "When I saw this in the Xbox Store earlier, I thought it was a joke. I laughed reading the description. But I had to admit, it was definitely an original idea. I went ahead and bought it, figuring if it was bad it was only $5. But luckily, it wasn't a bad game. It's very buggy and the camera keeps jumping around, but it was clearly a cheap game from a small developer, so for what it is it's a well-made game.\n\nI played several rounds, and it's more intense than you'd expect. For starters, there are boxes everywhere, and any one of them could be another player. You have no idea which one is a person unless they move around. Usually there's a ten minute limit, and the first five minutes, no one wants to move. Everyone just looks around and slowly moves. Unfortunately, when you look around the box moves, too. But the last few minutes, it usually delves into chaos, everyone running around trying to kill each other. But it's actually kind of funny , seeing a bunch of boxes going at each other with box cutters.\n\nI think my favourite moment while I played was actually a bad moment for me, but it left me impressed. I was chasing a player from room to room, but then I lost sight of them. I walked around and then he killed me. I went back and reviewed the gameplay footage afterwards and they had simply stopped moving. They'd blended into the other boxes so well that I didn't even notice, and in the heat of the moment I thought they disappeared.\n\nI think this game is good, but also that it could do with a bit of work. The biggest thing being fixing the glitches. Either a patch or a bigger budget sequel. Either way, this game is worth the $5.",

Cuando supe que saldr\u00eda Oxenfree II estaba muy emocionada, y ahora que lo jugu\u00e9 estoy muy feliz, a\u00fan sigo prefiriendo el primero, pero este no es una mala continuaci\u00f3n. Abarca temas familiares, no saber qu\u00e9 es lo que quieres en la vida, fracasos, decepci\u00f3n, y superaci\u00f3n, perdidas familiares, enfrentar a la vida aunque no est\u00e9s preparado y no sepas qu\u00e9 es lo que te depara.  \nEl juego es hermoso en pr\u00e1cticamente todos los sentidos, amo este estilo de juegos, el arte, los paisajes, las conversaciones, el misterio, la m\u00fasica, siento que todo encaja y todo est\u00e1 donde debe estar, no hay nada fuera de lugar, y eso es hermoso. A pesar de que el arte es el mayor fuerte de este juego, debo admitir que su historia es muy buena, y adem\u00e1s tiene mec\u00e1nicas interesantes y diferentes, la radio es mi cosa favorita, y el walkie talkie es un buen recurso, no sabes c\u00f3mo se ve Maria o Evelynn, o Nick, pero sientes su compa\u00f1\u00eda y a veces es hasta reconfortante hablar con ellos, no solo para buscar informaci\u00f3n, sino simplemente, hablar, ya con eso el juego se siente m\u00e1s vivo, y me gusta. Como dije antes, prefiero el primer Oxenfree, pero es porque fue la primera experiencia, a\u00fan no sab\u00eda de qu\u00e9 trataba el juego y descubrirlo mientras jugaba era m\u00e1gico, no por eso este es malo, sino que simplemente ya sab\u00eda m\u00e1s o menos de qu\u00e9 se trataba.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n es un muy buen cierre a lo que es Oxenfree, y tiene obras de arte muy hermosas.\n\nMusica/Audio: 8/10\nArte: 9/10\nHistoria: 8/10\nPersonajes: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n",

The game-play is easy to pick up and understand from the start, even though you might want to read the \"guide\" that comes with any new treatments. The core game-play loop, however, gets tiring very quickly, and is frankly confusing (you will see what I mean when you get messages at the start/end of each day). For me, in order to want to play and finish this type of game, I have to absolutely love the story, which did not happen in this case. Still, I will recommend this game to try to anyone.

Paranormal and spooky things are happening and its up to you to face off against an ancient evil to save your daughter\u2026just remember: don\u2019t knock twice.\n\nThe game Don\u2019t Knock Twice is loosely based on the 2016 British supernatural horror film by the same name.  While labeled as a first-person survival horror; the game is basically a haunted house walking simulator with no survival elements.  Don\u2019t Knock Twice is an interesting, albeit short, game where there you will travel through the house looking for items and solving several puzzles to attain your goal\u2014to rescue your daughter. \n\nThe spooky atmosphere is elevated by the dark, mysterious interiors of the house, the sound effects that manage to thoroughly spook you, and the occasional jump scare or two.  Overall, the atmosphere is the real gem of this game and very memorable and creepy.\n\nSadly, Don\u2019t Knock Twice is far from perfect.  The story seemed poorly conceived and the game has little to no substance\u2026if you saw the movie you kind of know what was going on but the game does not add anything to the story.  The game is visually dark, too dark\u2014even after upping the lighting it was ridiculously hard to see anything.  Additionally, there seemed to be sound cues for creepy things happening but I didn\u2019t see them\u2014either the location was extremely dark or I was facing the wrong way or the sounds were just there for creepy atmosphere.  Last, but not least, the text messages from the daughter are not only annoying but remind me why I don\u2019t carry a cellphone with me all the time.  I want to explore the house, not have some annoying teenager text me more than a political campaign asking for donations.  \n\nUsing the controller was maddening and it was not intuitive nor was it fun.  I ended up using the mouse and the keyboard and, with the exception of having a difficult time opening doors, there was no issue.  Since the game was originally developed for VR; I can see why the controller is an issue, and I recommend using the mouse and keyboard if you are going to play this game.\n\nAchievements, however, are fun and relatively easy.  You will need to play the game at least twice as there is two different endings.  Because the game is relatively short I did not mind playing Don\u2019t Knock Twice a second time to get all the achievements I missed the first time through.\n\nDon\u2019t Knock Twice is not a bad game, but I have a hard time recommending it\u2014especially for full price.  While it is very beautiful and dark and very atmospheric there is really no substance to the game which makes Don\u2019t Knock Twice rather unremarkable and forgettable in the end.  I am, however, glad that I played it and would urge you to wait until its on sale if you are interested in this game.",

          "content": "RPGolf Legends melds two distinct elements into a fairly cohesive experience. Combining a golfing mechanic with an RPG is an interesting and unique idea. However, blending these two together causes the game to stumble in some aspects.\n\nFirstly, there's golf. The golf mechanic is very enjoyable and somewhat relaxing. There's an assortment of different clubs to choose from, and, in true RPG fashion, you can even buy upgraded sets of clubs as you progress further in the game. These upgrades can boost your range and your attack damage (since you'll be hitting enemies with the clubs in addition to golf balls). Each hole has a par, as you would expect, and you get rewards for achieving or outperforming par.\n\nThe second aspect, of course, is the RPG mechanics. The game consists of a segmented open world that will open up as you progress further. Each area contains 9 golf holes for you to try to beat to get to the next area. However, since it's an RPG, you'll have to unlock the holes, either by killing monsters or by completing quests. The quests are pretty uninteresting, mostly fetch quests or kill quests, although there are some interesting ones in there as well. Additionally, there are bosses and dungeons that you will have to beat in order to progress.\n\nDialogue is pretty well-written, and contains a lot of good humor. The music is relaxing and fits well, and the pixel-art graphics are nice to look at.\n\nCombat is decent. Basically, you can either swing your club to attack or use it to block an enemy's attack. There's also special attack powers that you can obtain. Unfortunately, many of the boss battles are lacking. Bosses tend to have a bunch of hit points and only one attack phase, so you'll be constantly dodging the same attacks and then going in for a couple of swings every once in a while. There were a few boss fights where I wondered if I was even doing them correctly, since it took so many hits to kill them.\n\nThe problems with this game mostly arise from areas where it blends golf into the RPG. Unlocking holes is sometimes pretty tedious, where you'll be farming enemies, then running to the next hole to play golf, then back to farming enemies. In fact, by the last two areas, the game seems to become somewhat self aware of how tedious it was getting and the requirements to unlock the last 18 holes were dropped, meaning that you could play straight through the 9 holes in each area before having to go back to the RPG. That made these areas much more enjoyable to play.\n\nDespite its flaws, there's still quite a lot of enjoyment to be had here, and I found myself getting engrossed in both the RPG elements and the golf elements.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10",

Music accompanies the mood of this game upon pressing play on an old cassette player.\n\nGameplay is kinda like \"escape room\".

          "content": "The end of a life is not necessarily the end.  Waking up from what you assumed was your last moments you find yourself going back through your life; from your youth to your old age alongside the woman that you love.  Here you remember your journey and make sense of life before the final goodbye.\n\nArise A Simple Story is a narrative third-person platforming game which focuses on a very human story.  You play as an old man who dies and finds himself in Limbo where he goes back through his life chapter by chapter.  You follow his memories of his one true love, his triumphs, his sadness, and the eventual end of his life in a fantastically powerful game that tugs at the heartstrings.\n\nGames can be art and Arise A Simple Story is a great example of this idea.  The world is beautiful and done is a stunning art style that is both angular and soft.  Throughout the game you will find Memories that tell the story within each chapter and expound upon the tale.  Each level is a look back on the protagonist\u2019s life, starting from early childhood to old age and are brilliantly themed, colorful, and emotive.  Additionally, the soundtrack throughout the entire journey is impactful and works well with the story presented.  These items, in conjunction with the wordless story, make Arise a true work of art and one that will stay with you for quite some time.\n\nThe main game mechanic of Arise is the ability to move time forward or backward and each level has its own reason to do so.  For example, progressing time forward in one chapter changes the season from winter to spring and opens paths that might not normally be accessible while in another chapter time forward or backwards controls a raging fire that devours all within its path.  Coupled with simple platforming; the game becomes a little more intricate as well as interesting as your progress through the story.\n\nIf one negative thing can be said about Arise A Simple Story it would be the platforming.  Arise is a beautiful game to look at but it can be a chore to play.  While the main game mechanic is exciting and feels fresh, the platforming mechanic is frustrating and feels rushed.  With the fixed camera system, and a camera that sometimes moves while you are leaping, you end up dying a lot while jumping from area to area which slows down the game as well as the story of the game.\n\nThe achievements are not only challenging but fun to get as well.  While there are achievements for completing each chapter; the vast bulk of achievements will be attained by finding all the memories as well as completing certain tasks in each level.  These special tasks range from jumping a hundred times or collecting dew drops to not freezing to death or touching fire.  All the achievements in Arise feel as if they are a part of the story and not just something thrown in there\u2026a definite bonus especially for achievement hunters.\n\nArise was a wonderful and heartfelt story from its grand opening to the moving final credits and an experience that I am sure to remember for quite some time.  From the epic environments to the sweeping musical score; Arise offered a beautiful story told without words in which you can take part and experience alongside the protagonist.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game to everyone, no matter what genre or style game that you may play.  Arise is a simple story well told and one that should be experienced.\n",

Honestly, the result is much better than I expected. The dungeon play was fun, the dating sim part was just fine, the overarching narrative was interesting enough to keep me going, and all of this mixed together made for a fun snowy afternoon. Despite me treating this game as expanding my gaming horizons, and I wouldn't actively look for games of this type, I enjoyed my time with Boyfriend Dungeon. Kudos to the devs for pulling this off!",

The studio is known for their work on mobile platforms and previously developed games like Devious Dungeon.\n\nThe game was published by SureFire Games.\n\nThe director of Grimvalor is Mika Karras, who is primarily associated with Direlight and their mobile game projects.\n\nThe script for the game was likely handled in-house by the development team, as specific screenwriters are not widely credited for Grimvalor.\n\nThe music for Grimvalor was composed by Scott Lane, and he is recognized for his work on several other mobile games, such as Shadow Bug and Raid Manager.\n\nThe game utilizes the Unity game engine, a widely used engine in the gaming industry. Unity has been employed in various other games, including Hollow Knight and Cuphead.\n\nIn terms of graphics, Grimvalor features detailed 2.5D environments with dark and atmospheric aesthetics. The character designs and animations are smooth and fluid, contributing to a visually engaging experience.\n\nThe game's sound design and music help create a dark and immersive atmosphere. The sound effects are impactful, enhancing combat and exploration. The music by Scott Lane complements the game's tone, contributing to the overall ambiance.\n\nOverall, Grimvalor offers a fine action RPG experience with solid graphics, sound design, and an engaging atmosphere. Sadly, it gets too frustating and repetitive in the long term. ",

The places you have to visit are well-detailed, highly grotesque, and full of discovery potential. I have to congratulate the game designer(s) of the game. There are lots of well-designed moments in the game, that make it much more deeper. Also, the narrative is blended masterly with art style and gameplay. \r\n\r\nOK, there are not very polished animations here and there, some UI/UX elements could have been thought better. But trust me, you won't think about them twice. It's not a long game but totally satisfying. I can't wait to play another game from the same hands. \r\n",

The graphics looks gorgeous within the limitations of the whole pixel art stylization. For my taste the game could have been even a bit a shorter and more condensed, as the bosses and enemies are reused multiple times. The last few levels feels just like a buildup for the final battle and my dear it is brutal. When I have finally beated the game I felt true relief and satisfaction.

In short, there are only about 3 types of bosses, you will defeat all of them already in act 1, but then you will meet them again and again, mixed up, only the levels will be higher.. levels - this is a facepalm for a boomer shooter, small enemies don\u2019t have levels here, everything is fine, but why did they have to be made for big ones.. when they already demanded 5 clips each, and there were no interesting tactics for fighting them.\nBut Boltgun could become the right \"Doom 3\", all modern \"old\" shooters for some reason forgot that the original Doom had awesome memorable designs of weapons and enemies, remakes, for example, generally ignore this part of the legacy of the originals, and relied only on cor. gameplay, in Boltgun everything is fine with this + colorful effects of shots, the aesthetics of \"Warhammer\" fits perfectly into the concept, and this is the only thing that connects the game with a huge series, don`t be afraid, there is no lore here, the plot too just get from point a to point b and kill the heretics, and the flying-head companion only serves as a source of a couple of jokes and guides. There are some sober ideas in the gameplay, for example, we are very fast, but at the same time the character feels rather heavy, which, it seemed to me, a little, but fresh, there are \"super\" clips for the machine gun, but their differences are microscopic, gigantic keys amused, corresponding to the spirit of gigantism of locations, but there is also a bunch of shortcomings, again, the uselessness of the assistant head, the lack of interesting secrets, which is extremely necessary for this genre, all the secrets are ordinary rooms that are just a little harder to notice, about some mini- games/puzzles, I generally keep quiet, even no platforming, 1-minute section in the middle.. from what I remember, fast mini-bosses are not slowed down by any type of damage, which could also significantly reduce irritation from them, gunplay good, but every chapter the entire arsenal is reset without explanation, and then the same guns for some reason get into other places in the slots, which creates confusion when you need to quickly select a weapon.\nIn general, I like the approach of the Warhammer publishers, which gives money for experiments in the universe in various genres, which expands the overall fan base very well and allows you to reach even those players who have never touched this series at all (like me), but why was it necessary to force the developers to make of an ordinary boomer shooter such a long and expensive product, forcing them to copy-paste a lot and not pay enough attention to the gameplay? They didn\u2019t even have time to come up with music, only some kind of beats. \ud83e\udde1Boltgun is forever in my heart, but I don\u2019t advise anyone to play it for more than 2 hours)\n\n\ud83d\ude0aSubscribe on my Steam`s Curator`s page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\n///\n\u041d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439

The portal gun, however, is a blast to use.

The puzzles were just the right difficulty when it came to solving them and the game was simple to understand and quick and easy to learn. It's a rather simple game really with a boomerang of a story that I was not expecting but really liked how through your playthrough, if you decide to take your time to explore each area you get a bit of an idea gradually of what type of game you could expect. Portal from the beginning had that uncanny feeling of being alone with the music setting the atmosphere and the juxtaposition of acting like a friendly puzzle game but being much more than that.\r\n",

The level design is crafted well, and it just felt like a fun world to explore.\r\n\r\nWhile you don't you get any weapons aside for the portal gun, the game still has combat to a degree, as you are sometimes dropped in these areas where there are turrets everywhere, and you have to use the portal gun in creative ways to sneak up behind them, or drop them in a portal to somewhere else. How Valve was able to approach combat situations with puzzle solving was a masterclass in creative level design!\r\n\r\nI also really enjoyed the story and Glados as an antagonist with her sarcastic commentary as you play through the game. I remember playing through the training levels until I found the first room outside of the training course that hinted at what was really going on and I just loved it!\r\n\r\nThe game is very short though, but I have heard that like Left 4 Dead, the first game is really just a demo and a foundation that the second game expands on, so I look forward to playing Portal 2 now!",

The UIs are quite janky in terms of design (though they are quite functional), but that and the bullshit that is gold on all challenges are really the only problems with the game.\n\nThe artstyle is great, GLaDOS is easily one of the best villains of all time, and the puzzles are expertly designed. New mechanics are introduced at a great pace - even at the end of the game.\n\nAnd for those who want more Portal, there's 6 advanced puzzles (one of which is utter bs, but the rest are great), challenges, and a sequel with way more content.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game.\n\nAnd I'm making a note here - huge success.",

          "content": "As someone who enjoyed Fallout Shelter on PS4, and that's big for me since I play almost no mobile games, I enjoyed this one as well when it actually ran smoothly. I was surprised at some of the RPG depth the game has as you can create your character, pick your race as they all have certain perks just like in a traditional ES game. I also like the leveling system even though it is similar to Fallout 4 in that its just a big skill tree. You can pick abilities from either a magic tree, a stamina tree which are your weapon abilities and then a more general perk tree which is handy. You can also build up your town with houses, as well some service places like a blacksmith or alchemy shop to make you potions. That is where the timers for this game come in, but it honestly doesn't bother me. I only ever sit down and play 20-30 minutes before setting something to build and logging out.\r\n\r\nI was also just surprised at how generous the game is with gear, as I was constantly picking up good weapons and armor to swap out, or I would just improve the gear I had at the blacksmith. I also love the music of this game even though its a shorter OST. They can't really use Jeremy Soule anymore for reasons I won't get into, so Inon Zur composed it who works on the Fallout games and now Starfield. I do love his music but I don't think he's the best fit for Elder Scrolls. However, if they got him to do this mobile game I imagine he will probably do ES6, but that's just my speculation.\r\n\r\nAs for combat, its decent for a mobile game, however I definitely would have preferred to play this on a Switch if I had one, as I am not a fan of the touch screen to use your weapon. It can be very unresponsive at times, as your character will cancel their strike rather then execute it. I do hope they bring this game to more platforms as right now its only on mobile and Switch. A PC port on steam would be way preferable in terms of performance which I will get into shortly. The graphics are decent and I do love how in most levels you can find secret areas for extra loot.\r\n\r\nTo quickly touch on the story, its okay and some of the missions in the quests tab, are very cool with me recently doing one where I had to clear spiders out of a village and then take on their queen. They can be fun at times, and since this game is set in Cyrodiil your character was formerly of the Blades which I loved. You also get to explore Aeylid Ruins which was a nice call back to Oblivion. Overall though, the story is average and nothing that really kept me playing, or want to finish it before writing this review.\r\n\r\nMy main issue was the performance. I don't know if its just me having a lower end model phone, but this game ran really bad most of the time. Sometimes it would run super smooth and I would really enjoy my time, others the framerate would drop to like 5 frames a second when in combat or even when just walking around. It made getting through a lot of quests very unenjoyable even though I enjoyed the gameplay loop. Either way, if their putting this game up on the Google play store, then it should run well for everyone regardless of what model of phone they have. Thankfully this game is free to play, because otherwise I would deduct more points.",

Seeing the main character also helps to humanize them a lot more.\n\nOnce again, the story told is incredibly engaging, dealing with heavy concepts in a very abstract way. Each of the endings really makes you think, and each gives a unique perspective on the main character's struggles.\n\nThe soundtrack really complements and adds to the whole atmosphere of the game. Visuals are very creative, and I like that each ending uses a different art style.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10",

The game started off with baby-steps tutorial (or should I say baby crawls...:P). The developer of this game understood how to mimic a real snake movement into a game controller binding keys. Thanks to the lack of lives (tries) and unlimited time the game lets you explore the levels as much as you like. Plus, it won't punish you for failing.\r\n\r\nAs I was saying, gameplay wise, the control of the character (his name is Noodle) is unique and satisfying with a level design that will challenge your skills and adaptation to those unique mechanics. \r\n\r\nThe level design is good initially and with every world, there is a new element added to it (Lava, rotating poles, wind etc). With that being said, the levels become more and more mundane as they don't add enough to hook me up for long.\r\n\r\nIf a story is something you were looking for, you will find almost none of it, just a generic adventure with a mute protagonist and its sidekick without any twists nor character development.\r\n\r\nOverall is a very likeable 6 hours game in order to beat and probably few more hours in order to collect all the collectables. Hopefully, it will get a sequel which will live up to its full potential",

Enjoy siege battles, card games, spinning tops, collecting tops, farming monsters for rare gear and items, spend a decent amount of time getting that one character that needs a very specific timing window, build your town, and run through all your emotions on this beautifully crafted JRPG.

I have been playing it since release, enjoying and savoring every bit of nostalgia satisfying morsel this game has to offer.

We control a strange pokerface very small man, and every normal sized character we meet asks us to launch/bring/find something, and we just smash everything with 1 click and willy-nilly this is the solution to each problem, that is, as linear as possible, wherever you go - you always successfully \"flow\" in the direction of the plot, although from the middle of the game we will have to backtrack a little along the same routes, yes, new secrets for achievements always appear in the city, you can \"knock out\" new lines from the residents, but still a little \"stifled\", the game almost turns into a classic quest \"pixel hunting\" in the end, but doesn`t have time, the total duration is 2-3 hours, optimal for such a thorough concept.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude0a \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddef \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude06 \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa`\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff`\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf4\ud835\uddf2: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550\r\n//\r\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0430\u043b\u044f \"Frobisher Says!\" \u0441 Playstation Vita, \u0432 \u0421\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0443\u0436 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \"\u0413\u0443\u0441\u044f\" - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439-\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0434\u044c \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b \u041d\u0435\u0442\u0444\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0441\u0430, \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439\u0441\u044f \u0447\u0451\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0438 18+ \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0451\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044f\u0445, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e \u0441\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0447\u0435\u0439, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043f\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0430\u0441\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438, \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u044f \u0440\u0430\u0437 7 \u0441\u043c\u0435\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 2 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c;

          "content": "Amnesia: The Dark Descent, developed by Frictional Games, stands as a true masterpiece in the realm of survival horror gaming. Released in 2010, it redefined the genre with its intense atmosphere, innovative gameplay mechanics, and deeply immersive storytelling, cementing its place as one of the most terrifying and influential horror experiences of its time.\n\nThe game places players in the shoes of Daniel, an amnesiac who wakes up in the eerie halls of Brennenburg Castle, clueless about his past and the horrors that await him. Armed with nothing but a lantern and the instinct to survive, players must navigate the darkness while struggling to maintain their sanity.\n\nOne of the game's most brilliant aspects lies in its psychological horror. The atmospheric design, chilling sound effects, and subtle psychological manipulations conspire to create a sense of dread that gnaws at players' minds long after they've put down the controller. Amnesia expertly employs a unique \"sanity\" system, where witnessing horrifying events or staying in the dark for too long causes Daniel's sanity to wane. This, in turn, distorts the player's perception of reality, making them question what is real and what is a manifestation of Daniel's unraveling mind.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are designed to induce fear and vulnerability effectively. Unlike traditional horror games, Amnesia discourages combat, leaving players with no choice but to run, hide, and outsmart the relentless and otherworldly creatures that stalk them. This emphasis on helplessness intensifies the feeling of terror and survival, making every encounter with the unknown a heart-pounding experience.\n\nBeyond its terrifying gameplay, Amnesia: The Dark Descent boasts an intriguing narrative that unfolds through the discovery of journal entries, notes, and memories scattered throughout the castle. As players piece together Daniel's past, they become deeply invested in the character's journey, further immersing themselves in the chilling atmosphere.\n\nThe game's visual and sound design deserve immense praise. The dark and hauntingly beautiful environments, combined with the haunting soundtrack, create an atmosphere of palpable dread. The attention to detail in crafting the castle's architecture and the hauntingly grotesque creatures only adds to the overall sense of immersion.\n\nWhile Amnesia: The Dark Descent is undeniably a gripping and unforgettable horror experience, it may not be suitable for all players. Its intense and psychologically taxing nature may be too much for those sensitive to horror or jump scares.\n\nIn conclusion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a true tour de force in horror gaming. Its atmospheric brilliance, psychological terror, and innovative gameplay mechanics set a new standard for the genre. If you're looking for a deeply immersive and terrifying gaming experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat, prepare to enter the darkness of Amnesia - you won't be disappointed.",

          "content": "What this game gets right is that creepy atmosphere, having to manage limited resources and seeing some truly messed up things. This is illustrated very well with the sanity mechanic where your character can't even look at any of the enemies without having a nervous breakdown, or seeing things that aren't really there if your sanity level is too low. Couple that with how light is your most valuable resource, through tinderboxes to light torches and candles or having to find oil for your lantern. Its just all the ingredients that make this a fantastic horror game. The Soundtrack as well is fantastic with some great themes. The puzzles as well are very good and I loved the very Resident Evil style approach of having to combine items in your inventory to solve most of them.\r\n\r\nI also quite enjoyed the story, as it a mystery in the beginning but as you slowly uncover what the protagonist and antagonist were up to before hand, and their relationship, it becomes a lot deeper and very disturbing. The story was pretty cool and had a lot of fantasy vibes to it by the end.\r\n\r\nOnly real issues I had was not the story itself, but more just how it was delivered. There are no NPCs to have face to face conversations with for the majority of the game, so often you'll come into rooms and the game does this thing where the screen gets a dark filter on it, and you hear voice over to serve as a flashback. During these times your movement is slowed down and you just have to sit and listen until its over. Its an okay storytelling device but after a while it got annoying. I much prefer to listen to voice over while I'm playing normally like in the Bioshock games. There are a lot of notes to read but I didn't have an issue with it since the majority of them are voiced, with only a handful requiring you to actually read them.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is the enemy AI can be a bit dumb. Since there's no combat you have to hide from enemies, but most of them were never really a threat, as they always make a loud noise whenever they spawn in, to which you can just run back to a previous room, and hide in a corner until the enemy despawns which most of the time happens pretty quickly. I was almost never discovered other then one time where I tried to run past one of them (and died), or if it was a scripted sequence.",

The way in which you capture and research pokemons is genuinely interesting, and the world as well as the plot are really fun to walk through; an excellent mix of old and new ideas coalescing to create a really a vibrant world and an overall great experience. I think the battle system's a tad flawed, although I can't blame it too much; it definitely was a gambit, to add the styles, and I think it worked decently well. I think it has some issues, especially regarding grinding, which feels more counterintuitive than in other games, and the characters, which are rather forgettable, if not annoying, but past that, it's a solid entry with a good premise that I enjoyed a lot.

          "content": "Pok\u00e9mon Legends Arceus makes a lot of changes to the core Pok\u00e9mon formula, following what feels like a natural evolution for the franchise that fans have been envisioning and waiting for for so long. A common complaint many people have with open world games is that there isn't a whole lot to do in the vast spaces these games tend to provide. And while it's true there isn't much to fill the world, it honestly doesn't matter. The Pok\u00e9mon, environment, and crafting materials are more than enough to give the player plenty to do. The mechanics that Gamefreak has introduced are absolutely brilliant and are the highlight of the entire game. Despite the story being quite boring and poorly written, it has never been more fun to battle and catch Pok\u00e9mon. The UI is informative, looks sleek, and is well designed. However, the organization of the menus is atrocious. Why the menus are spread out over 3 buttons is a mystery to me. There are a lot of things this game does right, and a lot it does either ok or just wrong. Even elements of the story are very interesting, but the way its told is so bland and boring. One thing I really don't get is why so many textures are ugly and blurry. I just don't understand if that was a stylistic choice or if someone messed up the texture import settings or what. Regardless, the game is still fun to play and many of the texture issues aren't present while out in the field catching Pok\u00e9mon, which you will spend most of your time doing. If Gamefreak took the time to refine and polish everything here, Legends Arceus would itself be a legendary game. ",

          "content": "To start off with the visuals. The game reminded me a lot of the Resident Evil 1 remake in its lighting and visual design of the environments. The fact that the game takes place mostly in a mansion definitely adds to that and I quite enjoyed it. The only thing that isn't the best are the character models that look a little too uncanny valley, but it is a AA title so I'm not going to knock it too much. While the game makes you think it will be like Resident Evil it actually quickly turns more into Silent Hill as you unlock the later areas with blood soaked walls and an excessive amount of gore in the environment. You always just feel uneasy as you're moving through the rooms, like something is going to pop out at you and with the fixed camera angles, it adds to the uncertainty as you don't know what will be waiting for you in a room when you first enter it. While I tend to prefer the over the shoulder, third person or first person camera styles in horror games generally, I do admire how they used the fixed camera angles here and some of the angles they chose when in certain rooms added to that uneasy feel. Kind of like the bathroom scene at the beginning of Silent Hill 2.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere has this oppressive feel as you feel trapped in this large mansion with no one to really help you. You will find plenty of dead bodies lying on the floor or on operating tables throughout the mansion/hospital as well as blood and guts in various corners. You can clearly see the bodies have been butchered and messed with, making you wander about who or what exactly did this. The game also features a couple of jump scares throughout the game and while I am usually not a fan of jump scares personally, but they were pretty well done here, happening when you least expect them. One of them in particular definitely gave me a jolt when it happened.\r\n\r\nNext we have the music and sound design which is really well done overall. The OST has a lot of beautiful piano melodies while also having a lot of screeching intense tracks that really build up the games atmosphere and make you feel like you're in a hostile environment. The sounds the monsters make are disturbing and the loud moans they scream out when you kill them really sends a shiver down you're spine. The voice acting though isn't the best with their only being a few characters with dialogue, including your main character. While I would have preferred better voice acting, it added to the nostalgia a little as these types of games never had the best voice acting to begin with. The sound design overall is very well done.\r\n\r\nMoving onto gameplay, it plays very much like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, with its gameplay loop of exploration, combat and puzzles. I enjoyed exploring the mansion with all of its nooks and cranny's, finding secret passages and plenty of things in the environment. The puzzles were enjoyable too with some pretty brain buster ones to solve. While it does get a bit much towards the end, I found the puzzles to be another great aspect of the game. The combat plays very much like I said before, akin to Resident Evil and Silent Hill in that you ready your weapons before attacking. The weapons you find feel very makeshift and unconventional because there are no traditional weapons lying around. You a get a nail gun in place of a pistol, a shotgun which is literally just some pipes duck taped together, an electric lance that can be used to shock enemies from close range and a good old fashioned crowbar. Unlike Silent Hill, you can't really get through the game with just the crowbar as most of the enemies are melee based in their attacks, and your character can only take a few hits before dying. The best strategy is to often shoot the enemies and when their down, hit them with your crowbar to finish them off. The weapons overall felt good to use, especially the shogun which has a nice punch to it whenever you fire. Your inventory is also thankfully unlimited and with clear categories of key items, resources and files. I also like how the map of the mansion is an actual physical map you have to select in your inventory and rotated around to read. While the map does mark some key items, I feel like it could have also marked things like ammo or health items you missed which is a QOL feature that many modern horror games use.\r\n\r\nThe enemy design is another thing I want to talk about before the story section. The enemies all look like Frankenstein like monsters with various blades and spikes stuck to their arms and bodies. At the same time their torsos and faces all look butchered and mangled like their barely holding together physically. While the various enemy types look samey after a while, towards the end they do introduce some new ones that look very different which I appreciated. Some enemy types feel redundant though like the wall enemies who have such giant blades for arms that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that you shouldn't go passed them. Dealing with them is as simple as walking up next to them and just hitting them with you're crowbar until they die, and they can't fight back from that angle, so their inclusion in the game feels very pointless. About halfway through the game they introduce a stalker enemy. The design just looks really lame and I didn't find it intimidating at all. You do find out later the story reason, why the stalker enemy is there which I won't spoil, but overall it just felt redundant from a gameplay perspective. The best thing to do is when you enter a room and hear the stalker enemies theme is to just go out and come back in again, as they usually will disappear. It just a waste of resources fighting it.\r\n\r\nFinally we can talk about the story. Caroline receives a weird photograph of two twin girls, addressed to her. She travels to the mansion from where it was sent only for her to be knocked out and then wakes up in a bath tub naked and hooked up to a machine. She must now find the missing girls and escape! As you explore the mansion you will find dairy entries and files from the family members that used to live in this mansion. The story they tell is very sad and disturbing and it adds context to much of what is going on. The notes are short and don't feel long winded to read, so I recommend reading all of them as it enhances the story overall. It gave me a lot of Silent Hill 3 vibes as you learn about a cult that controlled this family and their intentions that are evil in nature. Overall, I really loved the story as it took elements from many horror games but did its own thing with it. It makes me excited for the sequel they announced and how that game could play out.",

          "content": "I rarely find myself gravitating towards the puzzle genre. While I\u2019m fine with them breaking up the action, I generally stay away from games primarily focused on hurting my head. Well, that was the case, until I picked up Luna: The Shadow Dust. This 2D point-and-click puzzle adventure is a tale full of mystery and wonder, presented in beautifully hand-drawn graphics and animations that I adored.\n\nLuna: The Shadow Dust presents a very curious world. You begin in a Dark environment, that looks almost like a desert. While you explore, you meet a ghost who guides you to a Tower where the rest of your journey takes place.\n\nAlong the way, you meet a small furry companion who helps you progress through anything that stands in your way. Slowly but surely, you reveal the wonders of this strange place, all done through cutscenes without dialogue. This creates an interesting sense of immersion for the player, and embodies the saying \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d.\nThe game plays in a very \u201coff-handed\u201d manner, where player interactions and puzzle design detail the narrative. While this way of storytelling works for some games, I had trouble trying to piece together this world. The puzzles give you glimpses into a culture that values art and music, a land full of magic and mystery. However, I left with only a small understanding of what this world has to offer.\n\nThe biggest bonus to this kind of storytelling is being able to display the bond and connection between two characters. As you progress the story, the bond between our two main protagonists strengthens. The way their interactions pair with one another to make solving puzzles feel natural adds to the game\u2019s enjoyment.\nOne of the major features of the game is the stunning hand-drawn graphics and animation. These animations have been drawn frame by frame and it shows during gameplay. This level of detail creates smooth, beautiful looking animations that helped tremendously with the game\u2019s immersion. Even at only 12 frames per second, all of the walking, climbing, and interaction animations are impressive.\n\nThe soundtrack is also favorable. The music is light and lovingly composed. It wraps you in a world filled with mystery and intrigue as it is winds-focused, with a strong emphasis on flute, as well as harp melodies. The music overall adds character to a game that has a lot to show for itself.\nNow, what about the gameplay and the puzzles? Honestly, it\u2019s what you would expect from a classic point-and-click adventure, clicking to move around the level to interact with objects is what you\u2019ll find. This is standard fare, and I personally found no issues at all with this gameplay. It was simple and straight to the point, and playing as both characters is fluid with the press of a button.\n\nIn regards to the puzzle design, I found a lot of them to be entertaining, as it becomes more challenging as you progress. It\u2019s the kind of puzzles that forces you to take some time to plan out an approach. There are unique ways to get through levels, such as having you mess with the lights in a room, alter color patterns, and many others. Overall, it is an experience that is worth having.\n\nLuna: The Shadow Dust is a nice nod to classic point-and-click puzzle games. Everything melds together beautifully, and it provided me with a solid puzzle experience. Despite my aversion to this genre, I found the experience pleasant overall. Some of the puzzles left me stumped, but after getting through them I felt accomplished in their defeat.\n",

Despite the well written dialogue, the character doesn't feel interesting. Also whatever \"gameplay\" is there might as well be non existent.

I dont know why it has a score this low here - but personally i really enjoyed it.\nThe concept its very simple, you are an anthropomorphic bird who needs to reach the top of a mountain, and to do so you'll have to take a short hike. Or that's what your aunt said, at least.\nYou are going to walk a lot (duh), explore, and make some friends along the way. \nThink it like a veeery small Breath of the wild x Animal Crossing.\nYou have to kind of like the genre, i guess. Which i do. eheh\n\nIn conclusion i think that it has veeery nice concept, and hypothetically, if expanded, (both sidequests-wise and world-wise) It could turn into one of those amazing game where you lose track of the time, but it's not, so it's just a short game, about a short hike.",

The 3ds games influenced It's visuals, looking like a low-res zelda game. It uses a pixelated vilter to simulate a 3ds game, but the devs give you the choice to turn it of, although they don't recommend it. I'm glad the devs gave us the option to turn it off, although it'snt recommended by them.\n\t\n\tThe soundtrack is also amazing, giving a good atmosphere for the game. The dynamic soundtrack gives a good amount of variation, so you don't feel sick of hearing the same song.\n\t\n\tThe core mechanic in the game is hiking. Your main goal is to climb to the top of the mountain. The task itself is quite easy, being able to it in less than a couple of hours. The main thing is that will probably want to explore the island, collect everything and meet It's people. I'ts quite refreshing, it doens't feel like most games that have a artificial way to increase It's length.\n\t\n\tYou will meet a lot of funny characters asking for help, inviting you for events inside the game and so on. Everything in this game have e upbeat tone, like a minigame that you can't lose because you are both playing for a common goal. You can also chill fishing while hearing the game's soundtrack. The upbeat tone also goes to the game's challenge, having no death penalty. The challenge itself is the climb and to find hidden treasures through the island.\n\tI recommend this game for people who are'nt familiar with videogames in general, or people who want to have a short experience. Be sure to exaust the dialog with the npcs, sometimes even if you already met them.\n\t\n\tA Short Hike was a impressive game that has a beautiful art as well as Its sountrack. The npcs could be more well developed, but I understand as the game's goal is to be short. \n",

          "content": "My Hero Ultra Rumble is the latest addition to the ever-expanding lineup of My Hero Academia video games, and it's safe to say that it doesn't disappoint. As a dedicated fan of the series, I couldn't wait to dive into the world of quirks, heroes, and villains in this new release. While it may not be perfect, My Hero Ultra Rumble offers an engaging experience that will keep fans and newcomers alike entertained.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Presentation (4/5):\r\n\r\nVisually, My Hero Ultra Rumble delivers the vibrant and dynamic style fans have come to expect from the franchise. The character models are faithfully recreated, with each hero and villain exuding the same charm and personality seen in the anime and manga. The environments are well-designed and packed with details that immerse you further into the My Hero Academia universe. However, there are some occasional frame rate drops during intense battles that could use some optimization.\r\n\r\nGameplay (4.5/5):\r\n\r\nWhere My Hero Ultra Rumble truly shines is in its gameplay. The core of the game revolves around fast-paced, arena-style battles that capture the essence of the series perfectly. The combat system is easy to pick up but offers depth for those who want to master it. Each character has a unique set of moves and quirks, and you'll find yourself experimenting with different heroes to find your playstyle.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of various game modes adds to the game's replayability. The story mode, while not groundbreaking, offers a satisfying narrative that follows the events of the series. Mission mode provides diverse challenges to tackle, and the online multiplayer mode lets you test your skills against other players. However, it would be nice to have more offline multiplayer options for local play.\r\n\r\nStory and Fan Service (3.5/5):\r\n\r\nMy Hero Ultra Rumble attempts to retell the story of My Hero Academia, which is a tall order given the complexity of the source material. While it does a decent job of summarizing key moments, it feels rushed at times, and newcomers might find it hard to fully grasp the narrative. However, for fans of the series, it's a fun way to revisit familiar events and see them from a new perspective.\r\n\r\nThe game excels in its fan service, with a wide roster of characters to choose from, including both heroes and villains. Playing as your favorite characters and unleashing their quirks is immensely satisfying, and the attention to detail in their moves and abilities is commendable.\r\n\r\nAudio (4/5):\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack of My Hero Ultra Rumble captures the energy and excitement of the series, enhancing the overall experience. Voice acting, too, is top-notch, featuring the original Japanese voice cast. The only minor drawback is the limited number of voice lines during battles, which can become repetitive after extended play.\r\n\r\n",

As a dedicated fan of the series, I couldn't wait to dive into the world of quirks, heroes, and villains in this new release. While it may not be perfect, My Hero Ultra Rumble offers an engaging experience that will keep fans and newcomers alike entertained.\n\nGraphics and Presentation (4/5):\n\nVisually, My Hero Ultra Rumble delivers the vibrant and dynamic style fans have come to expect from the franchise. The character models are faithfully recreated, with each hero and villain exuding the same charm and personality seen in the anime and manga. The environments are well-designed and packed with details that immerse you further into the My Hero Academia universe. However, there are some occasional frame rate drops during intense battles that could use some optimization.\n\nGameplay (4.5/5):\n\nWhere My Hero Ultra Rumble truly shines is in its gameplay. The core of the game revolves around fast-paced, arena-style battles that capture the essence of the series perfectly. The combat system is easy to pick up but offers depth for those who want to master it. Each character has a unique set of moves and quirks, and you'll find yourself experimenting with different heroes to find your playstyle.\n\nThe inclusion of various game modes adds to the game's replayability. The story mode, while not groundbreaking, offers a satisfying narrative that follows the events of the series. Mission mode provides diverse challenges to tackle, and the online multiplayer mode lets you test your skills against other players. However, it would be nice to have more offline multiplayer options for local play.\n\nStory and Fan Service (3.5/5):\n\nMy Hero Ultra Rumble attempts to retell the story of My Hero Academia, which is a tall order given the complexity of the source material.

Not a masterpiece, but the next best thing.\n\nIt's quite useless to point out it's every strong point (main of which is it's graphic design \u2013 it's an outstandingly beautiful piece of game art), so I'd rather just point out it's main failure, and it is narrative design. Given the (small) number of characters, they are very sparingly detailed, and involvement with them is suffering for this. There's simply too little narrative content per character, and given it's small volume, it's weak interaction with the rest of the game is especially noticeable.\n\nHowever, despite weak overall narrative, you shouldn't beleive some things you may read about the game's ending. The ending is actually good, if not great. I'd dare anyone to make a better one, and even would bet money on their failure.",

          "content": "\t1. GAMEPLAY\r\n\tLeft, right and jump is all you need to know control wise, for the whole of the game. Boss wise is the same way excluding jumping sometimes. Making sure you jump and move to the Electric rhythm that the stages give you is a great feeling, especially when the music starts off with just a few beats and hitting checkpoints gives the music more life, adding even more technologic groove for your ears to hear. From point a to point b there really isn't much fault and learning the timing for the level plus the boss is a fun time and great accomplishment. Then heading into the mirror levels, which is the previous levels with the added factor of new colors and one life. A testament to trial and error and getting *gud*.\r\n\t\r\n\t2. STORY\r\n\tI...Hmm, well the story of 140 is nonexistent. But for this game it really doesn't need that, though if you wish to have some sort of story for this game then you play a transforming geometric shape on a stroll through some dope electronic music. \r\n\t\r\n\t3. SOUND\r\n\tAnother section where everything slaps really, the music is beat-tastic, and the little bleeps and bloops from movements you do is par for the course. The low hum when you step into a checkpoint or level and the after affect sound is a great little transition sound effect. Not much here again to talk about besides simple things.\r\n\t\r\n\t4. MUSIC\r\n\tNow for the heavy hitter in this section! The music is top notch, the opening track for the startup of the game is a great start to what you'll hear and get into, Once into a level I enjoy the fact as to how the music presents itself with just basic notes that coincide with one another until you checkpoints that fills the void with more and more fantastic beatsies. Each level has a great track and each boss has that same feeling too. Besides the *Title* track the first level Pt.1 and Pt.1B are fan-fucking-tastic, especially when it hits you with that consistent stabbing notes at the end of Pt.1 to lead into Pt.1B. The wubs and kick basses in Pt.1B are a nice groove when \"shooting\" the moving sphere Boss and that disorienting note that hits when the music gets sinister and calm. All in all I could go on and on about every single track in this game about what parts I enjoy the most and make a list on which tracks I like from least to best but you're picking up what I'm putting down, a masterpiece electronic soundtrack.\r\n\t\r\n\t5. ART DIRECTION\r\n\tGeometry, geometry everywhere. From your little shapeshifting\u2026shape, to the cool backgrounds of each level that gives you those sweet blocky soundwaves. Again in this section there really isn't that much to talk about, the music fits perfectly with the aesthetic of geometry and nothing really is out of the ordinary besides Bosses giving different type of gameplay.

Even then, however, the game is not without its flaw.\n\nThe main plot and the concept of the game (Werewolf game and the loops) are the main charm of the game, and in this regard, the game has a very well defined, well crafted mechanical execution. The story, at a glance, is really damn good as well (Until the ending anyhow...) but the characters, especially the main ones, are hard to love at best, and consistently pulling the game down at worst.\n\nAs an experience and a VN, I highly recommend the game. I think playing the full game once will not waste your time, even if you don't end up liking the thing. A second replay on revelation mode/the extra content might, however, as one of my harshest critiques of it is that a lot of the things that would make the plot/characters better/bearable are locked behind new game plus.",

          "content": "TL;DR\r\n\r\nOne of the best modernized SNES-era-JRPGs out there. Comes very close to a masterpiece, but falls just short.\r\n\r\nGeneral Thoughts\r\n\r\nThis is everything I wanted FFXV to be. This game is a shining example of how to take an SNES-era style JRPG, bring it up to date with modern JRPG mechanics and mix in a few Western-RPG game mechanics. It's a perfect mix of charming story telling from Dragon Quest, Sprite/Character art from SNES-era Final Fantasy, Press-turn-like battle system from Shin Megami Tensei, and Class system from Bravely Default. It may seem like I wrote a lot about what I didn't like, but this is I enjoyed the game so much and found that it did things so well that it was obvious to point out where it fell flat.\r\n\r\nThe Good\r\n\r\nGraphics and art style\r\n\r\nI'm always a fan of very stylized graphics/art style (Wind Waker, DQ8), as I believe these hold up much better than standard graphics/art style. The character sprites look great, monster and boss art is interesting, environments are beautiful.\r\n\r\nBattle system\r\n\r\nThe battle system as a whole is really satisfying. While I do think it is a step down from Bravely Default, I still think it's a great take on a modern turn based system. The boost/break system allows for some really challenging and almost puzzle-like boss fights - where you have to balance between using your BP to break the boss faster or save it to deal out the most damage after you break the boss.\r\n\r\nQuest system\r\n\r\nAs someone who gets overwhelmed by all the quests and collect-a-thons in modern console games (Wither 3, Assassin's Creed, Horizon Zero Dawn), I found it really refreshing how bare bones the quest system is. I love that there's no way points to lead me to the next step in the quest. I love that you actually have to read what the NPCs are saying to know what to do for the quest. I love that you have to think about which character's field ability you have to use to solve a particular quest.\r\n\r\nClass system\r\n\r\nI'm a sucker for games with classes (like FF5, DQ7, Bravely Default, Etrian Odyssey) and this game does not disappoint. There's not as many classes as in something like Bravely Default, and you can't customize each character as much (you can only change their sub class and 4 passives), but the classes are well balanced and each one is useful in battle in some way. There's still enough customization that you can build your party to defeat challenging bosses in different ways to capitalize on your party's synergies.\r\n\r\nThe Not So Good\r\n\r\nNo overarching or central plot\r\n\r\nStory-wise, the main problem with the game is that there is not really a central plot. The driving force of the game comes from the player's interest in the 8 mini-stories. The mini-stories are not terrible, but they are not great - and most definitely not on par with even the side stories of characters in games like FFVI or DQ7. For people who value a great narrative, I could see how this could be a huge turnoff. Unless people are drawn to the gameplay mechanics, I imagine most people will just complete the stories of the few characters they like.\r\n\r\nMain characters don't interact in a meaningful way\r\n\r\nPlot and character interaction often go hand-in-hand. The fact that there is no central story to bring all these characters together means that they don't have the chance to have arcs together. The force of change in each character is the series of events that happen to them in their mini-stories. There are some mini-scenes similar in form to skits from the Tales series, but they are often only between two characters, we never learn anything new about the characters, and even the characters don't really learn anything new from these interactions.\r\n\r\nNo boosting into debt\r\n\r\nYou start off each battle with 1 BP and you can only boost by as much BP you have. This is my main major complaint with the battle system. I really wish that they would have taken the Brave/Default system from Bravely Default. This makes random encounters a slog, since you can't just 4x boost every character and defeat the enemies in one turn as you can in Bravely Default.\r\n\r\nNo encounter rate slider\r\n\r\nOne thing that I really would have loved is some way to completely turn off the random encounters - ideally the encounter rate slider from the Bravely Series. There is a character ability to reduce the encounter rate, but I really wish that I could get rid of them completely. I enjoy the environments so much that I really would have liked to walk between most locations, but I found myself fast travelling to avoid random encounters.\r\n\r\nNo beastiary\r\n\r\nThere's really no excuse for a modern JRPG to not have a beastiary of some sort. It's good that the enemies have their weaknesses displayed under them in battle, but I would have preferred an in game compendium containing more info about each enemy.\r\n\r\nThe way H'aanit talks\r\n\r\nOne of the 8 characters talks in what seems like an attempt at Old English(?) and it just makes things harder to understand and adds nothing to the character. It's enough to make me never use her in my party and only begrudgingly go through her chapters.\r\n\r\nEnd game battles rely on RNG too much\r\n\r\n(Note: I'm just getting to the end game, so I may come back and update this)\r\n\r\nMy main complaint is with how the end game treats physical attackers. So the general strategy against bosses is this: attack their weakness until they break, then unload all your damage. The quickest way to break bosses is with many attacks. The only good passive skills that align with this strategy for a physical attacker are \"Second Serving\" (50% chance to attack again after a basic attack) and \"Patience\" (25% chance to act again at the end of a turn). The other way a physical attacker can perform multiple attacks is though boost-attacking or using multi-attack skills like \"Thousand Spears\" or \"Arrowstorm\" but these attacks often miss - even with accuracy boosting buffs. This makes fighting bosses very frustrating as I've often found myself failing to break a boss when I was planning to because RNG made me miss more than I expected, or I've been able to save myself by randomly getting an extra action. Living/dying by RNG is never satisfying to me",

          "content": "Take part in a tale of love and loss in a heart-driven quest to change the past.  Time appears two dimensional but in order to change the past a tangled web of actions and consequences must be navigated carefully, or the past can\u2019t be fixed.  Is it fate, or can fate be changed?\n\nLast Day of June is a beautiful game, full of color and vibrancy, memorable characters, sadness, and love.  Inspired by Steven Wilson\u2019s song \u201cDrive Home\u201d in more ways than one; we take part in an interactive story and try to change the past through various characters intertwined with that fateful day.  The limited amount of characters are styled as what looks like wooden puppets, and the lack of facial expressions or spoken words lends to an interesting style that works very well.\n\nThe world of Last Day of June is beautiful, and I found the environment delightful and I eagerly explored every nook and cranny while thoroughly enjoying the scenery. The blurred painting effect of world in the background made the game feel like a dream and was impressive but was sometimes distracting as well.  The music goes very well with the theme and tone of the game with the only problem that I had being the music in the epilogue where a change in musical style from the rest of the game felt a bit jarring.  Additionally, some people may find the game agonizingly repetitive, but this is part of the narrative of the game.  Since there is no skip feature; you will be stuck watching the same scene play out if you messed up somewhere along the road.  This can be annoying but its not a game breaker.\n\nLast Day of June touches on a subject that many of us wish not to think about, but the way the game delves into the subject is impressive and memorable.  The story is deep and told in an interesting way.  The characters don\u2019t speak but instead make sounds which easily convey the story.  This device is so well done that you can still tell what is going on even though the characters don\u2019t have facial expressions or even speak.  \n\nWith the story, the style, the gameplay, and the music; Last Day of June will stick with you for quite some time.\n\nThe achievement system is good, with only three or four missable achievements which are easy to go back to and attain.  The achievements are satisfying and feel like a part of the story; making it a real joy to go after them even though you will get most of the achievements for simply playing.  Additionally, the controls are easy to pick up no matter keyboard or controller.  I ended up using the controller throughout the game as it seemed a bit more natural.\n\nLast Day of June is a heart touching game that you will enjoy and, perhaps, it will even rank up there as one of your favorite games played this year.  I enjoyed my time with the characters, experienced a wide range of emotions, and sat back with a long sigh when the final credits rolled.  I wholeheartedly recommend Last Day of June for those that enjoy graphically beautiful games with touching stories.",

As his sister navigates college, Lil' Gator wants to recapture the glory days of fantasy summers with his sister, and sets out, with the help of the whole town, to turn the island they live on into a fantasy land, complete with cardboard \"monsters\", quests, and a rockin' fort in the centre of the island. The game consists of you, as the Lil' Gator, roaming the island, helping friends, and building the coolest fort anyone has every seen, all to try and get your sister to stop writing papers, and to hang out, one last time. \n\nThis was a fun little game, very reminiscent of A Short Hike, with gameplay that focuses on helping others. The game is nonviolent, unless you count destroying cardboard cutouts as violence. Instead, it captures the grand fantasy games we all dreamed of playing as kids. The animation is cute, if a bit clunky, but the music and gameplay are solid. The game is also quite short - I 100% the game in just a few hours. Even so, I really enjoyed my time with this game. ",

I recommend buying the bundle that has all 4 games in it - especially when it's on sale.\n\nAlthough the game is short, it's very intriguing, and there were only 2 or 3 instances of me asking \"wtf am I supposed to do\" and having to look it up, rather than just rely on hints or click randomly.\n\nThere's not really much else to say honestly. The graphics are great, and the gameplay is solid.\n\nIf you're into puzzle games, buy this. And even if you aren't, it's a good introduction to the genre.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the \"clickable thing\" collision sometimes isn't very accurate, and the lack of proper settings (all sound is tied to the same bar, for example - hate when games do that). But, that's probably due to this being the studios' first game (or first PC port), and it's not that big of a deal in the long run.\n\nSo, in conclusion: Buy the entire Room series.

It's evidently crafted with great attention to detail and offers an excellent value for money. Three aspects deserve special recognition:\r\n\r\nThe clever structuring of game areas: Once you complete a specific area, it gets closed off to prevent you from getting lost. This clever approach ensures that the player always keeps track and can prepare for the next adventure.\r\n\r\nThe captivating environmental design: The game feels like a gigantic dollhouse waiting to be explored. Alongside the challenging puzzles, there are plenty of interesting places to discover, perfectly balancing the scope of the game and making the experience even more immersive.\r\n\r\nThe enhanced freedom of movement: Thanks to the direct connections between rooms and the main area, players can now navigate from one place to another with just a few clicks, without having to struggle through endless corridors. This seemingly small change significantly enhances the gaming experience and makes exploring the environment even more enjoyable.",

They even managed to essentially throw in some decent backstory as to why we are solving these puzzle boxes. I really appreciate how they executed this so effectively. It pulls you into the story from the first note and you find yourself excited to solve the next puzzle and find the next note to know what happens next. The difficulty of the puzzles gradually increases rather than going from 0 to 100 which is appreciated. I like that they laid the game out into chapters with different puzzle boxes in each chapter to also provide that feeling of progression as well. This game very quickly became one of my favourite puzzle games of all time for its simplicity. Not to mention, literally the easiest 100% achievement run ever! I'm sure some people would wish for the game to be longer but, honestly, since there were sequels made, this is actually the perfect length to introduce the basics of the backstory and how the game works.",

It's not going to scare older players and younger players who are in the age range to read the Goosebumps book series might be too young to fully understand how to play it. Some of the logic required to advance onward seems like it's too \"out there\" for youngins to understand (puzzles about Chess, developing pictures, etc). This puts Goosebumps: The Game at a weird crossroads where it won't give the thrills and chills that people who would understand how to play it want. That said as a fan of the book series I found this game to still be enjoyable. You do not need to have read the books to understand this game but if you are familiar with the source material then you'll recognize all the references and callbacks, some of which are necessary to advance through the game. The \"moon logic\" issue only cropped up a couple of times and I'll admit I had to look at a guide to get myself unstuck because the solution definitely wasn't obvious. The worst part of the game is a scene where you are aimlessly running away from a monster in the dark; I could not for the life of me determine if there was a hint as to the directions you're supposed to go or if it was just sheer trial and error.",

It is here that you will spend the most amount of your time solving color coded puzzles and experiencing some minor physics challenges. By completing these levels, you will progress into the story and unlock harder puzzle levels.\n\nThe story revolves around finding out what happened to you before your stay in the Penrose Hotel. It is only somewhat interesting as you start to learn more, starts losing interest in the middle, and then falls flat towards the end. The story and the hotel ultimately become a clunky narrative device for the puzzles, which probably could have been made into its own game.\n\nHalf of the achievements are easy to get as they are part of the story. Additionally, if you want all of the available achievements you will have to play the game twice as there are two different endings\u2014you cannot revert to a previous save to complete it and this type of system, forcing you to replay the game for the last achievement, is rather frustrating. I was severely disappointed that second half of the achievements for The Spectrum Retreat are not working\u2026from two years ago! The fact that they are listed in the Steam Achievement list but not activated is very disheartening and, in all honesty, even if they were put into the game tomorrow I probably would not play The Spectrum Retreat again just to get them.\n\nAll in all, The Spectrum Retreat is a decent puzzle game but the lacking storyline, unnecessary addition of politics, and the missing achievements compel me not to recommend this game. While the puzzles are mostly fun and challenging and the Penrose Hotel beautiful to look at; there are too many \u201cmehs\u201d that makes me say: give this game a hard pass and do not look back.",

          "content": "Tragedy has struck Youropa!  The Eifel Tower is now\u2026up in the air?  Using your special powers to walk on any surface you set out to save the Eifel Tower by walking right up it.  Explore a shattered cityscape and solve puzzles to move closer to your destination.  With some brainwork, some skill, and perhaps a bit of luck you can help save the famous monument from this strange anomaly.\n\nYouropa is a third-person puzzle/platforming game with a fun set of gravity-defying rules where you play as a Youropean and progress from one floating island to the next looking for doorways to the next level.  Some doorways will need to be powered up, some are guarded, and others seem unreachable, but rest assured there is always a way and all you must do is think outside the box for the solution.  As you progress you evolve your abilities, such as being able to run, jump, and other skills\u2026each skillset designed to help you with your exploration and progression.\n\nWhile the game is beautiful to look at, the real gem of Youropa is the playstyle.  Looking for a solution in many games means simply looking around, but in Youropa you need to think a bit more and do some exploration as many of the solutions are cleverly hidden and many of the solutions have multiple parts to figure out as well.  Finding out how to safely get to different places in the zone is just as fun as finding out what you need to do to move forward, and this made each level of Youropa a real gem.\n\nThe game is fun, but sadly there is no replayability besides the three difficulty levels and the workings of a system to build your own levels.  While the technology is there for designing interesting and exciting user-created levels it is not intuitive nor is it fun to work.  Perhaps, in the future, this will be a viable way to expand the life of this game.\n\nAchievements are split into two main sections: story and collectibles with some special achievements for doing game-related things.  None of the achievements are difficult and all achievements can be easily completed in one playthrough.  The game has a plethora of collectibles and finding and getting these collectibles becomes a game within a game.\n\nI found Youropa a fun experience and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I found myself becoming excited every time I entered a new area and a sense of completion every time I figured out a puzzle and moved to the next level.  The game does a great job in challenging you but not making it extremely difficult.  I recommend Youropa to those who love platforming games, for those who like puzzle games, and even for those who just want to play something a bit different.",

          "content": "Hmm, I was ready to forgive everything for the unique gameplay concept, but.. there is absolutely nothing to praise here, I understand that the game was made by 1 person, tried to at least somehow poor, but tastefully arrange inventory and other stuff using hand drawing, and it seems, in general, everything works, and I understand that the game will be liked by his fans or those who just want to support him for the work, but the game can still be improved,\nI'm really disappointed I was waiting for the game, the developer did it for several years, and for what? It turned out to be a simple joke for YouTube, just a joke that lasts for a couple of seconds or for 1 screenshot, there is a really good concept of an open world, where if you move far away from the train, you will be devoured by a monster that can also attack your train on the go,\nBut everything is done as primitively as possible, all the tasks of the open world - it's just bring thing from one place to another, click along the way, farm the rubbish scattered everywhere, you can also upgrade damage/armor/speed of train - that's it, that's the whole gameplay) It takes 2-3 hours to complete.\nThat's it, Absolutely all the tasks - are just a walking simulator with a couple of scattered props+1 mouse click, and you can also open chests in the simplest \"get in the circle\" mini-game. The plot: you came to the island to kill a strange creature, in the end you learn about 3 eggs that are guarded by Charles's cultists, which you need to collect and summon the boss on the altar.. it's even ridiculous to talk about characters and notes.\n\nAnd the last nail in the game`s coffin - is that fights with Charles do not cause any FEAR, 0 fear, PEOPLE, no atmosphere, by the way, either.\nWhat, 20 dollars, man, developer, are you ok? You are a youtuber, so you have the opportunity to advertise the game well, why so limit the audience of the game? I would recommend this maximum for mobile phones or in free form.\nPoor optimization and microfreezes are also present, if that makes any difference besides all this.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

          "content": "So I'm a little late to the party but Limbo is fantastic. Whenever a game comes out (and this is true of books and movies as well) I am always a stubborn ass and don't believe the hype. Mostly because it seems like when I do I'm always disappointed. So it happens sometimes that I wait to play/watch whatever it is and end up finding out that I love it. Such was the case with Limbo.\n\nI love, love, love the art in this game. It's very minimalist with only black, whites and grays. Even when you get to the inevitable (and often) squishing that inevitably happens to little Bo (that's what I named him, your tiny little squishable is unnamed as far as I know) it is weirdly graphic and yet not at the same time. If you're an uber-player you can probably make it through the first time without getting smooshed but a lot of the puzzles aren't obvious until they kill you. \n\nThe puzzles are environmental and very fun. They're challenging but you can usually figure them out by thinking long enough or experimenting with the objects/surroundings. Gameplay is relatively simple but fun. The platforming parts worked well and were enjoyable. Bo moves easily and fluidly and the physics are nicely done.\n\nThere isn't much of a story but it's a strangely compelling game. And generally I prefer story-rich games so I was actually surprised how invested I got in my little 'Bo's journey. He was tiny, he was small and everything was so big compared to him. I really, really wanted to take him safely through the game. \n\nI can't really spoil the ending as there really isn't one but the cycle is a bit depressing. I know there are theories out there on what is actually going on in Limbo but I haven't really looked into them yet. I didn't want them to color my review and interpretation of it. If I had to I think it's all summed up in the name - Limbo. You're stuck in a limbo cycle for whatever reason. All in all it's a fascinating, fun game with some replay value.",

The lethality of the traps and enemies in this game is heightened by the various visuals of you dying in a variety of different means which no doubt make this game memorable if not disturbing.  \n\nLIMBO is a puzzle platformer with a stunningly simplistic and beautiful setting, impressively diabolical traps and puzzles, and plenty of gruesome demises.  Do not expect to live but don\u2019t take it too hard as the developer\u2019s state that the game is a \u201cTrial and Death\u201d style game\u2014you are expected to die but somehow it isn\u2019t frustrating.  There were several times where my mind was blown away by the intricacy of the traps and my death count soared; but I felt highly rewarded when completing sections successfully.\n\nThe story was somewhat muddy as I was unsure what exactly was going on even though I understood the title of the game.  However, and this is a rarity for me, the confusing storyline wasn\u2019t too much of an issue with me as the gameplay was very engaging.  The mystery of the world and the story is what keeps my mind coming back to LIMBO.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy to learn, and the achievements were not easy but completable with a bit of thought and dexterity and, perhaps, a bit of luck.  Overall, a good game that I recommend for those who like puzzle platformer games, those who\u2019s sense of morbidity is heightened, or those who wish to test their mettle against this type of game.",

The environmental puzzles are also better than in the original, though there are still some obscure parts. The singleplayer is twice as long as the original, which also great.",

This game's story is a lot bigger and more engaging throughout. Glados is just as awesome as ever and I loved the companion Wheatley, voiced excellently by Stephen Merchant!\r\n\r\nThey also add in a lot more puzzle solving elements with the portal gun, adding in a lot more environmental tools for you to use to solve the puzzles with which I appreciated. The gameplay definitely has more variety then the first game.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is that the campaign I feel goes on way too long for me personally. I'm not that into puzzle games, and the first game took me 4 hours to beat, which was the perfect length for someone like me. This game just went on and on at times and I feel like the story could have resolved a lot earlier. The gameplay is improved but after a while it was dragging on and I just got bored which is why I took a break for a few months before finally coming back to finish it. The story is what made me want to come back but I was glad when it finally concluded.",

          "content": "I started playing back when the game was released on the Nintendo Switch, so around midway through Season 4. I enjoyed the game, and I continued to play it a lot through Season 4 and the last season of Chapter 2, but for the most part, the game started getting boring when I was not having fun with it. My friends started to play less and less, and the game started to feel stale. I can't say I'll ever go back because, over time, I started to dislike the Battle Royal gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay started to fade as time went on. I started disliking the flow of drop in the world, land, search for a gun, maybe kill someone in the area, then look for enemies on a huge island, and repeat till you win or till you die. I much prefer the gameplay of Team Fortress 2 or Overwatch 2, where you have a team and have guns on you already.\r\n\r\nThe art style the game has is nice. It has changed over time, and it was much better back when I first started playing, but the change is nothing to complain about. With the more 3D cartoon art style, it can be really pleasing on the eyes and make for cool events, which are shown through in-game live events.\r\n\r\nOverall, Fortnite was a fun game. I enjoyed the time I spent on it and the time I spent with my friends. Now-a-days, Fortnite seems more like a promo with fan-made and official game modes in it. I'm not saying the promo skins are bad; Epic Games did good on them. I just feel that they focus more on promo skins more than their own original work. and it became hell to go through the game mode selection screen because of all the fan-made modes that Epic, for some reason, put all into one small area.",

Not only that, but its short runtime is packed to the brim with charming characters, solid level design, a fittingly cute art-style, catchy tunes and creative enemies (emphasis on the amazing Megaman-like bosses).\n\nThe silly tone of Shovel Knight's world is infatuating, making every interaction throughout its runtime an absolute treat. However, this silly tone does come at the price of a somewhat minimal and predictable plot- although that's a minor point of contention, considering how Shovel Knights seems to lack any other short-comings.\n\nIf you're looking for a goofy yet challenging experience to sink some hours into, this game is a great choice. Plus, it's main campaign is nicely adjusted for co-op - which, in the many years since the first time I picked it up, has proven to be one of the main reasons I periodically find myself revisiting it.",

Each level is centered around its boss, resulting in each level being very different and showing lots of interesting mechanics. However the levels are designed in such away that you have to move in a very specific pattern. Which takes all of the fun out of the levels. You can finish each stage in 10 minutes, but on your first time it will take around an hour. In total it takes about 10 hours to finish the main game, which is a good length (but short for the price).",

There are also a few dungeons with lots of platforming, and a couple of such challenges are timed, but I found the timing fairly relaxed if you planned out your path beforehand, and these designs are actually the smartest part of the game.\n\nThere is also a bit of functional fighting, but it feels a bit underdeveloped -- after a while, I found more productive just to avoid enemies instead. Boss fights, in particular, are serviceable but uninspired, relying more or less on the same tactics for each one.\n\nThe second half of the game, in particular, feels a bit rushed, as if the developers ran out of resources to produce good dungeons. The whole world hints at something greater (the whole game has this Hollow Knight vibe, a sense of sadness that permeates a doomed world), but at the end there are too few characters and their stories feel incomplete.\n\nI am also pretty sure the music was inspired by Hollow Knight's moody soundtrack, and this is actually a high point -- the calmer tunes are very nice, if not as memorable. Graphics are nice enough, if you enjoy the stylized minimalistic style, and some of the architecture is impressively vertical (especially when you realize you will have to somehow climb that whole thing).\n\nAt the end of the day, despite a few shortcoming, I had fun with the game, and I still remember those cool double dashes and wall jumps in 3D. Score: 77/100.",

The character progression is basically the same as Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, in that instead of you gaining XP and leveling up, you just get skill points straight away from completing quests. It helps simulate the tabletop style of gameplay which I love. The game is also very linear with you basically going from mission to mission.

I also would have liked to have seen the seeker as a full time position, with the same rules applied to actual quidditch 150pts and the ending of the game. maybe have the 2 seekers do laps around the field and compete in a race the first 3min of the game to build an extra boost meter then when the race is over the player whom won will have a slight advantage on catching the snitch, which i think should be a little more difficult to obtain. other than that the AI keeper has some questionable habits like straying to far from the posts or behind them. The beaters and chasers mechanics are absolutely beautiful, and i have zero complaints or suggestions regarding them. ",

          "content": "Let's keep it nice and simple. In this game, you look at a pool and watch ducks. That is wholly it. every 5 minutes, a new duck spawns in. Clicking on a duck will let you spectate them, and clicking again makes them quack. You can also give each rubber duckie a special name in the collections menu. Some of the ducks do special actions every few minutes, like the Dragon duck breathes fire, and the propeller duck can fly. I can't stress enough that that's really it. Ducks spawn in, they float in the pool, and you watch them fuck around. It's so simple and there's, debatably, no game play at all, and yet I've put in over 10 hours while writing this.\r\n\r\nSince there's nothing much to talk about with the gameplay, then I'll move on to talking about the maps. With the DLC, there are 3 stages, Infinity Cool, Quacking the Ice, and Hippospace Download (inspired by the game Hypnospace Outlaw). Infinity Cool is my favourite. It's a basic pool with a few floaties on the side that can actually fall in. The top pool has a slide leading down to a hot tub area, which has a vacuum tube leading back up to the main pool. not too much there, but it's nice and simple. I didn't like Quacking the Ice initially. The upper pool is just a longer version of Infinity Cool's upper pool with a bit inside a ski lodge cabin, and a slide leading down to an Icy pond. I didn't think there was a way back up to the top pool, until I was utterly delighted to see a Zamboni come out of the shed and push the ducks into a mini cable car.  Hippospace Download is my least favourite map. It has a massive pillar in the middle with another pool on top, a lazy river section, and more than a few slides. there's a lot of duck based play features, and even a hidden usable catapult, but it's just too cluttered. With a massive spire in the middle, the camera gets caught way too easy.. \r\n\r\nThe negatives, of which there are only a few, need to be talked about. Once a duck spawns in, there's no way to despawn it, and the special and event ducks that can spawn in go away after the map is reloaded or quit. The camera can be difficult to say the least, getting caught and zooming in without input. I know part of the point is you have no control, but the inability to drag and drop ducks out of stuck spots and back into the pool is a sticking point for me. \r\n\r\n",

Choosing not to focus on that, World of Horror relies solely on its visuals and gameplay. However, to give credit where credit is due, the art style and overall atmosphere is phenomenal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the core gameplay loop felt repetitive and boring to my tastes, even though it offers replayability in the form of a \"quick play\" mode, which deals you random stats to you and your enemies and a \"challenge\" mode, where you have a specially unfavorable scenario to play through. On top of that, the game opens the doors to modding, leaving room for a community-powered foutain of creativity to quell one's thirst for more turn-based combat against eldritch horrors for a long time to come. Despite being a praiseworthy gesture, I can't evaluate the game based on third-party creations, so I have to focus on what the game has to offer by itself: The \"main story\" of World of Horror consists of a group of 5 random investigations which are, by themselves, each an unique \"story\". They are all very short (10~15 minutes long), making the overall gameplay loop no longer than an hour.",

I ended up to love the art, the music, the gameplay, the atmosphere. \n\nThe first negative point is that when reaching 90% or above the game become insanely difficult for me. The second negative point is a region that is so well hidden that you can complete miss out of quite some great content.\n\nBut knowing that the cherry team kept giving awesome DLCs, and that the price was so cheap for ages compared to other games, I give it 100%. \n\nCompletely deserved. \n\nI love this game.\n\n",

(Probably one of my favorite areas of the game because it really pushes your ability over the mechanics of the game). \n\nThe music really enhances the tone of the game. It's beautiful, haunting, and intriguing. The art is cute, but works so well. I'd also say that I loved the interactions with the world, the characters, and how cohesive the world felt.

          "content": "This game should be the reference to follow in any upcoming games of similar style.\n\nIn general as a game, it has so many details and content it is outstanding.\n\nThe gameplay, controls and movement, are quite smooth. Adding to this the base powers, it gives a very satisfactory feeling of movement and platforming, which leads too to great challenges across the game.\n\nThe story may be a bit obscure, maybe a bit open to interpretation, but in the end, it's very understandable as a hole with the many pieces you get exploring the world and throughout the game. \n\nOn the art aspect, it's very detailed in general, but the strong point here i would say is that every pathway is different, except for those one that make sense to be equal, and even in that case, there are different details. Great work.\n\nOn the music part, i think it's the weakest point of them all. Actually, I don't think the music is bad at all, but it is the part of the game that shines the least. Music fits in the game, but I don't recall any remarkable and unique song, and I think this is wasted opportunity and a bit sad.\n\nOn the sound part, again is great, you can recognize every thing just by its sound. This is very important, it gives an unique identity to everything that's going on on the screen, which many times is helpful due to the intense battles.\n\nAs a metroidvania, it has everything you would expect and further beyond. Powers, collectibles, side quests, challenges, remarkable NPCs, multiple endings, boss rush ... It is just incredible how much content there is in the game.\n\nOf course, it is not an easy game, it is challenging by default, but at the same time it's very rewarding,",

It all depends on which abilities you find first.\nEvery playthrough can follow a different progression order and that makes the replayability very high.\n\n\n***Very tight and balanced gameplay (combat and platforming).\nThe controls just feel so good when walking, jumping, slashing and navigating the world.\nEverything feels extremely polished, more so than many AAA titles.\n\n\n***Beautiful, beautiful music and sound effects that give you a high level of immersion.\n\n\n***Amazing art style, charming particle effects and atmosphere. Every area has a charm of its own and they blend into each other naturally in a realistic way.\nCharacter designs range from cute to creepy to gross to hilarious. But mostly cute. All of them look unique and interesting.\n\n\n***Challenging but fair bosses (except for the last DLC, that sh*t is impossible to 100% but it's optional. You can get through the main story with no problem).\nYou will have to practice and learn enemy attack patterns, and it feels very rewarding to get good at it.\n\n\n***Deep, mysterious story that you have to piece by yourself.\nHallownest is a fully-realized world with its own past, heroes and gods; it's an abandoned treasure trove of secrets.\n\n\nHollow Knight is one of my favorite games of all time. Up there on the same level as Dark Souls, The Witcher III and Zelda Breath of the Wild.\n\nGet it now. It's obscenely cheap for what you'll get out of it, even when not on sale.",

Just being in Hallownest, wandering around finding stuff while listening to the soundtrack.\n\nI strongly recommend buying this if you love metroidvania games, and/or games with deep lore and story (and interesting world design). Even if you're new to the genre, it's still a great purchase.\n\nThis (alongside the Ori games) are essential buys - especially for metroidvania fans.",

The puzzles are relatively simple and repetitive, which is not a big problem. For me, the problem was how slow some puzzles were to solve. And by slow, I mean how much time you need to go from figuring out the solution to actually solving it. This is a bad game design choice, but I cannot be too harsh on an indie studio's debut game, especially since this is my only problem with the game. The story pace is also very good, instead of slowing down towards the end, it does the exact opposite and for good reason. I cannot recommend this enough to fans of the genre.",

          "content": "Ace combat is one of those rare franchises that manages to deliver good to amazing games even more than 2 decades after its beginning. Ace combat 7 is no exception. It is a flight sim that presents flight in a very unrealistic manner. You are able to do impossible stunts, carry hundreds of missiles and other physics defying stuff. If you are a diehard player of realistic flight sims like DSC then I don't recommend AC 7, but If your knowledge of fighter jets is \u201cthey are cool\u201d then I highly recommend you give it a try.\nStory\nUnlike a lot of other modern flight sims this one has an actual story and fairly engaging one at that. Shortest way I can describe it is Metal Gear Solid, but worse. Storyline is set in a war between two countries in an alternate universe. It isn't your regular cookie cutter war story. By this I mean that it has some weird elements and a deeper moral message if you're willing to look for it, but it can also be very campy at times and that weirdness can go both ways. The worst part is the way they handle the characters. Some get replaced too quickly while others seem useless.\nGameplay\nIt is an arcade flight sim where as I said before you can do impossible maneuvers and can carry dozens of missiles. This applies to all the planes in the game of which there is a wide variety. They range from popular ones (F-22, F-15, Su 27) experimental (YF-23, Su 47, FB-22) to completely fictional (ADFX-01, X-02, Darkstar). You acquire them with points you earn during the missions. Grinding will be required if you want all the planes. In addition to aircraft you can also get special weapons, like missiles with very long range, extra guns and more.  Gameplay pacing is really good, as the mission you are playing is rarely similar to the previous. Bosses are okay, although they are rare. Returning players will notice one big addition to the mobility - PSM (post stall maneuver). They turn the previously improbable mobility to downright silly. Overall I would describe the gameplay as fun. There is also multiplayer but I couldn't be bothered with it.\nGraphics and artstyle\nSince you won't be looking at the ground at a very close range it can get away with lower quality textures while still maintaining AAA levels of graphics. Other than that everything else - plane models, weather, cutscenes make the game look very beautiful.\nAtmosphere \nIt did make me feel like an unstoppable ace pilot at times.\nSoundtrack\nProbably the best in the franchise thus far. The latin adds a level of mysticism that is just right for AC 7. Favorite part is \u201cArchange\u201d.\nFinal Thoughts\ndog.jpg\n",

Open-world exploration isn't exactly my cup of tea, and the way they incorporate guidance is far from perfect until you get the gist of it (it took me 12 hours to finish the game for a 6 hour campaign, because up until the first half of the game I was almost always lost as to what to do next - but maybe that's just me).\nThe story is also nothing too spectacular, but keeps you entertained enough. The world was build carefully to make you backtrack after upgrades if you want to discover everything but by the end of the game you realize it is smaller than you initially thought, and the \"secrets\" aren't that much worth sweating over.\nThe main questline, though, is incredibly enjoyable, the bosses and other enemies are fun to play against while still challenging you. Combat, shooting and platforming are all on point, carefully crafted to feel satisfying.\nWhile still having its flaws, I think it's overall an enjoyable experience, doing better at the stuff that matter the most in this genre. If you watch the trailer and looks like something you'd enjoy, you'll almost definitely not regret playing it.",

          "content": "\ud835\udff3/\ud835\udfed\ud835\udfec\nExpecting a competitor to \"Stray\" from a former Valve developer, we actually get the another low-polygonal \"Untitled Goose Game\" (even at this level the cartoonish visuals are spoiled by the red outlines of all models why?), this is a good platformer-collectathon, and here at least you can jump on the ledges yourself, The mechanics are not very dynamic and smooth, but when you get used to it, it\u2019s still quite pleasant, but this opens the way to technical problems of the game - there are a lot of places where you can abuse the system by overjumping in inaccessible spaces, for ex. I lost the opportunity to complete the quest with the phone, because I didn\u2019t pull the box out of the hole in the wall, and on the other side it was already impossible to get there. Because of this, it\u2019s not always clear where you can jump and you can even run into an invisible wall and fall from some kind of roof (you can\u2019t walk on wires either, although for some reason you can on very thin ledges), one time I actually flew through the wall, also from little things: people get stuck, and once I had a can stuck between a trash and a vending machine, but I managed to get it back to put it in trash - this is also a strange mechanic, because recycling cans allows you to farm a lot of shiny things, this very monotonous, but I want \u201cmoney\u201d, at the same time I opened all the purchasable hats, accumulating more than 100 pieces of garbage in stock, why did I do this? - You catch yourself asking this question, it`s not a tech. problem, but also a kind of ill-conceived game design,\n\nNaturally, there is no depth in the mechanics, the gameplay - is fetch something, sneak up, stroke, knock a person down, lie in the sun, and a lot of repetition tasks, a standard set of what you can imagine in a game about a cat, in Stray there was no depth of gameplay either, but there were many other unique features,\nand Little Kitty simply has nothing to highlight and nothing to recommend - only if you are a fan of opening platinum in cartoon worlds of standard quality,\nI still expected more from the former Valve developer, I wanted a real challenge to other animal games, and not just another \u201ccozzy\u201d indie eexploiting the cat theme (although personally, even the main cat model doesn\u2019t seem cute to me),\nFor certain types of tasks, you will only improve your climbing skill, which will allow you to climb higher on buildings, eventually climb back to the window of your apartment and complete the story, once again having a final conversation with the current set of animal characters, there seems to be good humor in the dialogues, most of the game can be completed in 5 hours, thanks to Xbox Game Pass, because the price on Steam cannot be considered a plus either,\n\np.s. By the way, here you can slide down the wall with your claws and jump in the other direction (like the mechanic of jumping from wall to wall), but I found the use of this only once on the final building, why at least this mechanic was not used a couple of times??\n\n\ud83d\ude0a Sub to my Steam`s Curator`s page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550\n//\n\u041e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 \"Stray\" \u043e\u0442 \u0431\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430 Valve, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \"Untitled Goose Game\" (\u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0451\u043c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u044f\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043e\u0431\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043c-\u0442\u043e), \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440-\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043d, \u0438 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f-\u0431\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u044b\u0433\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u044b \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0436\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043a \u0442\u0435\u0445. \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b -

          "content": "Double Exposure takes the dual endings of the first game and decides that Max ended up in basically the same place a decade later, which is absurd and takes away the impact of the player's choice in the first game. It furthermore disrespects the fans who chose to save Chloe by separating Max and Chloe for no reason other than it would be inconvenient to include Chloe in the game (and according to a former Deck Nine employee, higher ups in Deck Nine and Square Enix do not like Chloe). Effectively, this decision takes away all of the agency players had in making the final choice in the original game and does not restore any agency by giving players the option to reunite Max and Chloe. The game does absolutely nothing interesting or substantial to justify their separation.\nEven if you don't care about Max and Chloe's relationship, the breakup serves little point in the narrative. It\u2019s all setup with no payoff.\nInstead, this new game tells a mediocre story with choices that do not matter and an edition of the game that costs an extra $20 for little more than a few bonus scenes. It also attempts to treat Life Is Strange as an MCU story, when the whole point of the first game was to subvert superhero tropes. It's so bad that it's funny, until you remember that the game was made under toxic working conditions where Nazis attempted to include white supremacy symbols in the game.\nI will give the game a few points because it is far more explicit with its LGBT inclusion than previous entries in the series. But ultimately that rings hollow considering how they treated Max and Chloe's relationship.",

          "content": "The game's core mechanics are a good evolution of the those presented in the original trilogy, but the game falls down when looking at other components. Crash 4 tries to stand out from it's predecessors by including brand new gimmicks to the mix, including  Grinding, Wall Running, the 4 masks, 3 extra characters, unfortunately I ended up only being a fan of about half of these, whilst the others sit made the biggest flaw of this game even more aggravating, box hunting. \n\nTo premise this, I have 100% the trilogy multiple times for fun, both OG and N.Sane trilogy. But something about Crash 4 frustrated me enough that not only did I start to actively skip boxes but even optional levels to try and finish the game as soon as possible. \n\nBox volume and placement seem to not be placed in mind of being fun for the player but to entice re-playability. On basically every stage there are boxes hidden off screen in order to stop you from grabbing all the gems. Spending double to triple the amount of time on a level due to the sheer length of each, only to be off by one or two get's old real quick, and the notion of playing a half hour level in the hope you don't miss that box the second time is un-appetising in comparison to an OG crash game, where most levels are finished in 3-10 minutes for a non-expert player.  This is not helped by grind sections which almost always play as a guessing game, to figure out what's next, forcing you to kill yourself to restart (making 3 deaths or less almost impossible first try if you are looking at bosses. What should be fun characters in place of Dingodile and Cortex become chores since gathering those boxes takes an even larger amount of time (whether that be hoovering or specific platform placement) an even bigger chore when you die and realize you have to grab hoover up 100 boxes before the first checkpoint once more. Tawna on the other hand is just a strange character that feels off in the worls and feels incredibly bugger, with her wall jump and hookshot which seems to only work about 75% of the time. \n\nAnd then half way through the game,you are told you have to play through every level again to grab all the boxes with a skin change? I'm Okay, thanks.\n\nToy's For Bob, clearly put a lot of effort into trying to make this game live up to the original trilogy but, in my opinion, try to lengthen the game to fit \"modern length\" levels has put in incredibly strong strain on each and although I was ready to 100% this game when it was announced, at this point I am happy to leave it after the credits and move onto something else.",

In fact, this Crash Bandicoot 4 is the first game I've ever bought for the retail full price. I am not disappointed. The game keeps all core elements of the original trilogy, and most resembles the original. I keep thinking whether the developers really captured the feel of the Crash series. In the \"modern\" style, there are no \"lives\", but you get a death counter. To balance this, we got a more difficult game.\n\nThere is a lot of content here: original levels, inverted levels, flashback tape levels, multiple gems to collect (6 per level). The levels are long and HARD. This is not a game you just pick up, play, and finish. This is hard work. After finishing the last level, I felt exhausted, but given the incentives to play again - whether for collecting gems, flashback tapes, or trying out the inverted levels - I started from the beginning. The second play-through is a much more enjoyable experience. However, if you are a completionist, this is going to be a real grind for you. ",

The characters are mostly well written. The story, however, is kind of dull and not super scary considering it's a \"horror\" novel. The pacing is also all over the place and not all endings are very satisfying. Worth a read though due to the characters.\r\n\r\nOverall Score: 6/10",

The story is pretty simple, although it has its moments, both wholesome and scary, but the way the VN is structured, especially around the idea of 'consequences matter' is genuinely insane, with a massive flowchart and just really cool dichotomy between very different routes, such that playing the game in different ways can deal to very different versions of each character (This is especially notorious with the more contemptuous ones). About the characters themselves, they're really deep, at least most of them, and as the game allows you to play each one of them per chapter, it really helps you empathize with their issues and it enhances the way in which your actions affect other storylines. The minigames is one of the few things I'm not too happy about; they're very unnecessary and particularly annoying for the type of game this is. I like that you can skip them, however. That's good.\n\nThe game has a lot of moving parts and character endings that really offer an unique experience, excellent characters and a solid plot progression done through chapters that works real well, amazing art and bgm, and is just an excellent VN imo.

I was having a blast the first 15 hours on that side at least. I also like that you can upgrade and fuse duplicate cards together to make more powerful variants which is a fun mechanic. And I think they did well making each character feel distinct and cool to play with. A couple things annoyed me like some of the boss fights with one making me basically give up on continuing to play, since it was just not very well designed imo and the game just wasn't pulling me in enough to want to struggle through it. Also very annoyingly you can't skip enemy turns which just gets tedious as your forced to watch every single enemy do their moves and at the end of each turn enemies call in reinforcements, which just means you have more guys to waste your time, especially if your building up power and didn't take out too many enemies on a given turn.\r\n\r\nThe other thing is the graphics, which to be honest are not the best. Character models just look straight up ugly at times as they look like their out of a Sims game. Some moments the game can look nice but overall it's not a looker for me. The writing is also the one element that was heavily criticized and I would agree with people for the most part. There were some moments here and there like some of the scenes with Magik that were quite emotional for me, but otherwise it's mostly serviceable at best and cringe at worst. I found myself skipping a lot of the cutscenes because I just didn't care after a while. And the game really wants you to care with how much they try to use social mechanics from games like Persona or one of Bioware's RPGs. The problem is the writing quality is just not there to support it.",

This game was excellent for many reasons, and was constantly engaging and interesting. \n\nCombat was at times difficult, but always rewarding for this gamer. The music accompaniment to each combat section made it feel almost like a rhythm game at times, and the difficulty, although high at times, felt fair and rewarding. Unlike many games given the \"souls-like\" label, this one allows you to keep experience between deaths, allowing you to power up after trying your hand at a particularly challenging section.  I did find one or two sections to be teeth-crunchingly difficult, to the point where they felt more like a chore, but thankfully, this was only present in a few sections. \n\nOne of the standout features of this game is the gorgeous animation, and interesting character design. I got Ghibli vibes from certain characters, and for the most part, each character and level was exceedingly unique. Out of the varied levels, there was only one section of the Urn Witches mansion that I thought was rather uninteresting (the Furnace), and one boss that I thought looked a bit basic (think snowy level for a hint). These are minor criticisms. The story was also excellent for a game such as this; it was straightforward, but compelling to work through, and I enjoyed it immensely. \n\nI loved playing this game, and felt it was quite rewarding to playthrough. Having played on the Switch, the port performed well, with no crashes and constant framerate throughout my experience. Easy recommendation for fans of top down action-RPG's in the vein of early Zelda titles. Also a good experience for its challenging combat and world-building elements. ",

It was described to me as a very forgiving souls-like, and I had seen my boyfriend play it already so I caved and bought it. You gotta look at it as it's okay I'm gonna die at some point, let's just deal with it, laugh and move on. Very fun, not too much gore or anything, combat wasn't too problematic and was easy to learn. The increasing level of boss difficulty was good, it didn't just go from super easy to hard as nails immediately (there is some ability to choose which boss you visit first though). Would love to see them make a Death's Door 2.",

The art style is pretty but nothing new, although I was surprised by the lighting in different areas of the map. \nOriginal but weak storyline, main bad guy predictable. Very well implemented metroidvania elements, but the game didn't hook me enough to revisit all the areas and explore them again with the new upgrades. Well-made level design, reminiscent of Souls games, taking those detours and opening a door back to where you started. \nBosses are nothing special except for a couple. The final boss is a weak remix of the previous ones, with a couple of new attacks. Gameplay is simplistic but fun and it works very well. Cool music. Lots of enemy repetition, \nAll and all it's a short game definitely fun and worth spending time on.",

          "content": "Im Januar 2024 habe ich mir Final Fantasy 15 von meinem Pile of Shame geschnappt und im Stream gespielt, nachdem ich Jahre zuvor einfach nicht warm geworden bin mit diesem Spiel. Es war das Beste, was ich machen konnte. Durch meine Streams habe ich viele andere dazu motiviert, dem Spiel eventuell noch eine Chance zu geben. Und vielleicht motiviere ich den ein oder Anderen mit dieser Rezension.\r\n\r\nWorum geht es? (spoilerfrei):\r\n\r\nInsomnia - eine Stadt die jahrelang von einer Barriere gesch\u00fctzt wird und sich lange Zeit von der Welt abgeschottet hatte, schickt Prinz Noctis auf eine Reise. Noctis wird n\u00e4mlich im Zuge einer Friedensverhandlung mit Niflheim bald seine Kindheitsfreundin heiraten. Begleitet von seiner Leibgarde und gleichzeitig seinen besten Freunden:\r\n\r\nIgnis, Prompto und Gladio reisen sie mit ihrem Wagen \"dem Regalia\" durch das Land, um schon bald Altissia zu erreichen, wo er verm\u00e4hlt werden soll.\r\n\r\nDoch die Friedensverhandlungen erweisen sich als kompliziert und Prinz Noctis muss schon bald lernen, was es hei\u00dft, ein K\u00f6nig zu sein.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\n\r\nAnders als das typische rundenbasierte Kampfsystem - was der eingefleischte Final Fantasy - Fan so kennt - hast du in diesem Game ein \"action Kampfsystem\"\r\n\r\nAls Prinz Noctis hast du die F\u00e4higkeit, deine ausger\u00fcsteten Waffen wie aus dem Nichts zu beschw\u00f6ren und kannst deinen Freunden Befehle erteilen, die dich zus\u00e4tzlich im Kampf unterst\u00fctzen.\r\nGladio ist wie ein typischer Tank, Ignis k\u00e4mpft gerne mit Element-Dolchen und Prompto ein guter Fernk\u00e4mpfer.\r\n\r\nNeben dem Kampfsystem haben die Gef\u00e4hrten auch unterschiedliche Skills wie \"Kochen\" \"\u00dcberleben\" \"Angeln\" oder \"Fotografie\"\r\n\r\nDie Openworld:\r\n\r\nEinen Gro\u00dfteil des Spiels wirst du in einer offenen Welt verbringen. Die Openworld ist \u00fcberschaubar und nicht so \u00fcberladen mit Gegenst\u00e4nden oder Quests. Auch wenn die Map eventuell wie eine \"g\u00e4hnende Leere\" wirkt, sie kommt dennoch sehr realistisch r\u00fcber - stets im Wechsel zwischen sch\u00f6nen Landschaften und einem Highway. W\u00e4hrend ihr durch die L\u00e4nder streift, sto\u00dft ihr auf Notizen mit kleinen Infos \u00fcber die Story.\r\n\r\nDie Geschichte &amp; die Kritik daran:\r\n\r\nEinige werden eventuell schon geh\u00f6rt haben, dass FF15 sehr viel Kritik bez\u00fcglich der Story bekommen hat.\r\n\r\nDas hat vor allem den Grund, weil viele sich ein Final Fantasy versus XIII gew\u00fcnscht haben, was urspr\u00fcnglich d\u00fcsterer sein sollte und dann im Laufe der Zeit ver\u00e4ndert und in Final Fantasy XV umbenannt wurde.\r\nNoctis sollte urspr\u00fcnglich den Tod symbolisieren und ein Anf\u00fchrer von \"Reapern\" werden, weswegen die Jungs in der heutigen Version alle schwarz tragen und die Gruppe v\u00f6llig unberechtigt als \"Emo-Boys\" bezeichnet wird.\r\n\r\nHajime Tabata best\u00e4tigte bedauerlicherweise, dass er die Story umschreiben MUSSTE, um den Alters-Richtlinien anderer L\u00e4nder gerecht zu werden. Zus\u00e4tzlich wurde Nomura (dem eigentlichen Producer von FF13 versus) entzogen und Hajime Tabata \u00fcbernahm die Verantwortung f\u00fcr FF15.\r\nSquare Enix wollte ihr Spiel n\u00e4mlich gro\u00dffl\u00e4chiger in anderen L\u00e4ndern an den Markt bringen.\r\n\r\nDENNOCH ist Final Fantasy XV kein schlechtes Spiel!\r\n\r\nNebenaufgaben &amp; Jagdauftr\u00e4ge:\r\n\r\nDie Nebenaufgaben (blau) sind \u00fcberschaubar und belohnen einen mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Dialogen, Cutscenes und kleinen Hintergrundstorys \u00fcber die Charaktere, so dass diese nicht sinnlos und stupide erscheinen.\r\n\r\nDann haben wir die Jagd-Quests (Gelb). Besiege Monster und dann bekommst du Geld. Ist das stupide? Ja. Zieht es das Spiel vielleicht unn\u00f6tig in die L\u00e4nge? Auch.\r\nAber was macht man haupts\u00e4chlich als J\u00e4ger um seinen Lebensunterhalt zu verdienen? Richtig. Jagen. Vor allem am Anfang habt ihr Geld bitter n\u00f6tig.\r\n\r\nIch pers\u00f6nlich mag das Jagdsystem, denn somit konnte ich nebenbei auch noch ein wenig die Welt erkunden.\r\n\r\nWo ist meine Magie? Das Magiesystem:\r\n\r\nW\u00e4hrend \u00e4ltere Final Fantasy Teile bestimmte B\u00fccher mit Magie zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen, damit die Charaktere diese erlernen - musst du in der Welt an Lagerpl\u00e4tzen und in Dungeons die Magie (Feuer, Eis und Blitz) \"in dir aufnehmen\", \"lagern\" und mit anderen Elementen oder Items kombinieren.\r\n\r\nNoctis kann n\u00e4mlich eine begrenzte Anzahl an Magie absorbieren und kann diese erst wieder neu aufnehmen, wenn er die bereits gespeicherte Magie synthetisiert und aufbraucht. Je nach Element oder Item kannst du diese Magie dann verst\u00e4rken. Ein Heiltrank + Eismagie kann z.b Vita oder Vitra ergeben. Blitz Magie mit Maschinen-Teilen kann z.b die Blitzmagie verst\u00e4rken. Je mehr Items oder Magie eines anderen Elements, desto st\u00e4rker am Ende die Magie.\r\n\r\nMagie ist in EOS aber nicht unbedingt zwingend notwendig.\r\n\r\nDenn richtig eingesetzt, kann die Magie sehr viel Schaden machen und das Spiel um einiges erleichtern. Wer aber die Herausforderung sucht, der verzichtet vielleicht darauf.\r\n\r\nDungeons:\r\n\r\nDu hast Dungeons und diese sind gar nicht mal so schlecht. Sie sind \"schwer\" genug und interessant zu erforschen. Hast du aber eine sehr schlechte Orientierung, kann die Map ein wenig frustrieren, da die Verlie\u00dfe unglaublich verwinkelt sein k\u00f6nnen.\r\n\r\nFazit:\r\n\r\nGebt diesem Spiel eine Chance. Versucht euch dabei zu entspannen - denkt einfach an ein \"Wandertrip\"\r\n\r\nDas Spiel war n\u00e4mlich wie ein Urlaubs-Trip unter Freunden. Mich haben die Dialoge ziemlich abgeholt und unterhalten auf l\u00e4ngere Zeit, auch wenn sie sich wiederholt haben.\r\n\r\nSobald ich \u00fcber das Gr\u00f6bste hinweg war, hat mich die Story ziemlich gehittet und hinterlie\u00df mich zur\u00fcck mit Tr\u00e4nen. Wer ein dramatisches Final Fantasy spielen m\u00f6chte, dann ist das das Richtige f\u00fcr euch. DLC und Zusatzstorys gibt es in der Final Fantasy Windows-Edition. Einzig das Ardyn DLC musst du nachkaufen.",

          "content": "Another Crab's Treasure is the newest addition to the burgeoning genre of Souls-Like and it is a stellar game, I can't lie. This game has soul and wit, with visual puns and underwater-themed curse words that captures a blend of child-like wonder with the sad polluted reality that plague are oceans today. The story is simple with a character that feels all too relatable, especially for introverts like myself.\n\nThe perfect combination of fun and creative combat with beautiful level design, enhanced by neat visuals and incredible music that flows with your characters actions and vibes perfectly with the settings. The platforming was an unexpected treat with the use of being underwater utilized in ways that are very satisfying. Its a game that takes a lot from the games that're popular in its genre, but it executes them well, feeling more homage than cliche.\n\nThere were some performance issues, like frame rates plummeting/ stuttering. It was fairly consistent and the spots that had it always had it. It only momentarily took away from what was otherwise a phenomenal game. But I was very frustrated when these were happening towards the late game when enemies were around.\n\nThe boss battles are always my favorite part of an action/ adventure-rpg and Another Crab's Treasure nailed them in almost every way. As a Souls-like, I'd say its boss roster is as impressive as last year's Lies of P. I wish there was a New Game Plus or at least a Boss Rush Mode for after you beat the game as to experience them once again without having to sink 15-25 hours into a playthrough. Granted, you can always go to easy mode and strap on a gun and get through it in like 5.\n\nThe last two things I like to highlight were the voice performances. I. Loved. Each. Voice. I wish there was more of it, if anything. And this game nailed the easter eggs, paying homage to so many games, IPs, and undersea references - with a few standouts being its Dark Souls homages and the tribute to Frederick, Michael Reeve's famous financial fish (Reeves also voices the character Firth). And one last shoutout to the song at the end of the game (if you know, you know).",

          "content": "If your looking for an MMO without all the crazy combat.  With just the fun of exploring, grinding, and solving puzzles &amp; quests.  Then this is most definitely the game for you.\r\n  First, there appears to be no type of violent actions between fellow players and the NPC's.  The only type of violence found is hunting for animal meat and hides.  But even this show no type of physical harm.  Example: When shooting a deer with a bow, the animal just disappears and the loot is left behind.  No guts, no blood, no screams of pain.\r\n  I'm using a NVIDIA Geforce RTX 3060 on max settings, and the game looks amazing.   The environment leaves you with a feeling of calmness and relaxation.  Playing in this environment makes game play so much more fun and enjoyable.  \r\n The game also has different skill sets to build on. Like fishing, cooking, gardening, mining, hunting, bug catching, foraging, and furniture making.\r\n  You start the game with your own house that you can customize with items from the npc's or items you built yourself.  Your also able to buy clothing for your character from the in-game store to make the player your own. \r\n\r\n",

It's also 100% free, literally. Completely free. There's little, to zero bugs, which to me, is unheard of. The team always gives away awesome Twitch drops, which is good for streamers looking for more viewership and bringing in a larger community just looking to genuinely have a good time. The community that plays this game is also very helpful, giving tips or providing items you need or just want. Great for kids because the atmosphere in this game is awesome, it's made up of wonderful people looking to have a good time with friends and family. You can build, hunt, fish, forage, the list goes onnn. Great storylines, the voice acting is superb and gives the characters depth. The world is beautiful and the music is really stellar. They hired live orchestras, showing you a video on how it was created and made (my favorites are the Maji Market). They have Holidays in the game twice a year and you can play Hot Pot! All around 10/10 game.",

          "content": "Super Meat Boy is a wildly inventive, sadistically challenging, and extremely competitive game. It's squishy, lovable and full of life, and it\u2019s platforming at it\u2019s very best.\r\n\r\nTo start things off, no matter if your time is spent dying repeatedly or beating levels consecutively, the game flows together seamlessly. The controls really add sense of seamlessness as well, in that there's never a moment where you feel as if you've been cheated out of a victory.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is brutal, but it's honestly a bit refreshing to see a game come along with such a high level of challenge. This challenge helps motivate the player to keep going, to give a particularly difficult stage just \u201cone more go\u201d. Even after you've mastered a level, there's always this nagging sense of competition coming from the game's online leaderboards, challenging the player to discover new shortcuts or utilize different characters in order to shave off just a few milliseconds from a run. \r\n\r\nThe game is highly replayable in this regard, because in addition to trying to earn A+ ranks on a level, there\u2019s 101 bandages to collect spread across the game, ramping up the difficulty even further for those interested, even to sometimes frustrating degrees. But once you manage to get that bandaid, beat that level, or move up in the rankings, the sense of accomplishment is enormously rewarding\r\n\r\nThe game charms extend outside of the gameplay as well. The cutscenes are hilarious; the wonderfully animated expressions convey Meatboy's emotions perfectly, and the music suits the game's tone, almost giving you a beat to match your rhythm and timing as you make your precise little jumps. The graphics cover a wide variety of styles to original Gameboy graphics, to high definition B+W silhouettes.\r\n\r\nTo add to Super Meat Boy\u2019s quirks are the titles of the levels themselves, showcasing a playful admiration for creativity in its references, which range from metal bands such as Boris and Mastodon to cult film directors like David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky.  The game also includes free DLC levels that are updated fairly regularly and soon will include user created levels made by users of the PC version of the game. It'll be interesting to see how the two versions are able to interact with each other.\r\n\r\nIt's one of the most satisfying and addicting experiences I've had in years, and I love it with all my heart and soul. It's got the feel of retro arcade game with a modern day amount of depth to its physics. ",

That\u2019s my impression for every rpg games, and its not bad thing.\n\nBorderland is kind of the game that you hate to play due the repetitiveness in every single quest, shoot and loot by fight against one level up stronger enemies, fetching cryptic items to reveal storyline and also inflated money that is useless to use after getting strong item to equip. And still, players can really enjoy the game theme where you can pick four different class characters which the storyline consist of bounty hunter in wasteland planet called Pandora. \n\nThe humourous tone of story-telling that makes killing psycho looks fun meanwhile players get spouted of 00\u2019s meme catchphrase along the game by non-playable characters who are borderline of funny and annoying with the screaming and quips. Its very enjoyable storyline to get to know about an ambitious main boss want to control the planet which personally makes think its great writing of character who makes player chuckle in every single line the boss said any thing. \n\nDuring the game, players can get to know more stories about character and lore if doing quest where the game relies on audio recording instead of cutscenes, but don\u2019t bother too much doing all the task because some are too hard to do and player have to backtrack in any visited map if the players just want to progress the game only playing the main quest and that\u2019s it, some DLC are worth to play for story but being too dull if players are already over-level because killing enemy will become a chore than challenging, there is something about \u201cBS moment\u201d where sometimes if players are too over-confident to fight against horde of enemy, they are likely become more hard to kill and seems the universe in this game want you to die which cost a lot of your earning money. \n\nBorderland 2 is easy to play the game if players know how to build the skillset and know the role, eventhough I finish the game playing solo, this game can be fun as co-op game because the world and athmosphere of open world with its own unique style gives plus value because its not like AAA 3D games that will age after one decade. So its pleasing game to enjoy with friends or just playing alone.\n\nAs sidenote : Borderland 1 has slight different theme where its trying to be more serious game where later the tone in the sequel becomes more light-hearted and funny.",

The game belongs to the beat 'em up genre, combining fast-paced combat with a retro aesthetic.\n\nThe game was developed by Osumia Games, a relatively new studio known for their unique take on action gameplay. The director of \"Midnight Fight Express\" is Tero Piirainen, who has previously worked on other indie titles known for their creative mechanics.\n\nThe script for the game was penned by Dario Seyb, who has a background in creating engaging narratives for indie games. The music was composed by Jukio Kallio, a versatile composer responsible for the soundtracks of games like \"Nuclear Throne\" and \"Minit.\"\n\n\"Midnight Fight Express\" employs a stylized pixel art aesthetic that captures the essence of retro beat 'em up games. The game's graphics are heavily influenced by classic titles, and the visual effects enhance the old-school vibe while modernizing the experience.\n\nIn terms of sound design, the game utilizes impactful punches, kicks, and environmental cues to create an immersive auditory experience. This, combined with the pixel art visuals, contributes to a nostalgic yet fresh atmosphere.\n\nOverall, \"Midnight Fight Express\" deserves a score of 8 on PC due to its engaging combat, unique visual style, and well-crafted audio design.",

At first it's a bit corny and repetitive, but during the second half the game finds its pace, the story and action are working great together and learning new combos to take down enemies is fun and addictive.\nThat being said, of course the game has some negatives. I don't like that you can basically win the game by spamming only one or two combos, which is partly because most of the enemies are very similar in combat. You only have to learn a few basic mechanics, and then you are done. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it starts to show in a game with 6 hours of pure combat.\nI think the dev did an awesome job and added a lot of things for his game. I also think the story is polished and interesting enough for the theme, with a lot of references. I'm really looking forward to the implied sequel, where I hope for an even bigger and more complex skill tree as well as enemies.",

          "content": "Lights.  Camera.  Action!  Take the role of an actor on an ocean liner for a strange and mysterious project.  But something is wrong\u2026you aren\u2019t ready yet and the director urges you to put your character together.  Memory melds with darkness and strange things happen with every turn of the head.  Travel through the various layers of the ship and your mind to find your character, your story, and your fear.\n\nIt is important to note that Layers of Fear 2 is not like its predecessor.  While the game employs similar creepy effects and scares from the previous game; Layers of Fear 2 is still its own game with its own story and scares.  As such, I am going review Layers of Fear 2 apart from the first game\u2014giving it an opportunity to shine on its own.\n\nLayers of Fear 2 is a first-person exploration horror game\u2014with heavy emphasis on the horror.  Here you play as the protagonist, an enigmatic actor, onboard a steam liner with an mysterious Director giving you direction on how to build your character.  As you explore the ship; reality seems to bend and you begin to learn more about what is going on.  Five acts span the game where you delve more into the remarkable story with each act more horrific than the last all the way up to the thrilling conclusion.\n\nThe environment is truly creepy, and the atmosphere is dark, oppressive, and heavy; and it is this aspect of the game that is my favorite part about Layers of Fear 2.  The atmosphere really shines through spectacularly and strange scenes and eerie happening await you at almost every turn of a corridor or room\u2014causing unease as your walk about the ship.  It is important to note that there are several tastefully done jump scares as well as a couple of chase scenes that may cause a bit of anxiety.\n\nI enjoyed the story very much even though it was somewhat confusing after the first playthrough.  However, subsequent playthroughs helped solidify the story a bit more clearly.  I found the story deep and intriguing while still managing to be pleasingly enigmatic at the same time.\n\nThe controls are easy to learn.  You will spend a lot of time moving around, looking around, and picking items up and the means of control are intuitive.  I recommend using the controller although the mouse and keyboard are also a viable option.\n\nThe voice acting is spot on and the sound effects are perfect.  Every whisper, knock, or other sound you hear while traveling the storyline add to the discomfort while the voice acting gives the story in clear and concise manner.\n\nThere is a slew of achievements to attain; a good portion of which you will need to challenge yourself to find while others are based on the story itself.  Additionally, there are three separate endings, with their own achievements, requiring three separate playthroughs for those completionists out there.  As a note: there is a NewGame+ feature that unlocks after completing the game for the first time; allowing you to find additional achievements and mysteries that can only be found in this feature.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Layers of Fear 2 and I felt that it was a great sequel to the first game.  Everything collaborated well and gave a wonderful experience from start to finish.  I found the story to be quite exciting, engaging, and horrific and it is a tale that will stay with me for quite some time.  I recommend Layers of Fear 2 for those who played the first game or for those who love well-done horror games.  So turn off the lights, sit back\u2026\n\n\u2026and don\u2019t look behind you.",

          "content": "The shooting is really fun in this game, as you go from room to room in 2D side scroller fashion. It does use a twin stick shooter system, that I generally detest playing with controllers, but I have found its much better on keyboard and mouse. The game overall controled really well and I found it easy to zip around and take out enemies. The guns you pick up in this game are a lot of fun to use to. The game does feature difficulty settings which I'm not used to in these types of games and it felt nice to be able to play on something like easy. A far cry from games like Slay the Spire where you can only get an \"easy\" mode through modding.\r\n\r\nI also loved the exploration of the dungeons, as you go from room to room, as the map slowly starts to build out, highlighting key items and locations. As a QoF feature, it even highlights things you left over, like if you were at full health and didn't need pick ups but can easily travel back when you do need them. You also find plenty of fast travel points every few rooms to make getting around the dungeon a bit easier which in turn makes exploration more rewarding. You can also find special rooms like catherdrals that will often have cool relics, upgrades or equipment to pick up that gives you cool bonuses. You can also stack on multiple helmets, masks and hoods which can look ridiculous after a while but it just adds to the fun. As you kill bosses you pick up faith gems, which is the currency you take back with you at the end of your runs. These can be used to unlock new playable characters, as well as new types of rooms or game rules that can appear during your runs. This adds a fun building mechanic of sorts and you can toggle things you've unlocked on or off, which I found to be a nice touch.\r\n\r\nAs for story, there is one in the game, but its very simplistic. Its very meta about game development and they keep referencing Hades the game which I thought was cool. A lot of the items you pickup as well are references to other games and franchises which I liked too. Overall the story is mostly just in the background and isn't that groundbreaking, but the gameplay is fun which I think makes up for it.\r\n\r\nSome of things I didn't like are small, but they really dragged down the score for me. The first is not having a save and exit option mid runs which is a major drawback. There is an exit option which takes you back to the hub area, but doing this will make you lose progress in the dungeon but you do at least get to keep any gems you've picked up. Games like Slay the Spire let you save and exit mid run, and its very convenient since runs can get so long, especially in this game. As you defeat bosses, the dungeons just get longer and longer which doesn't help with their being no way to leave without losing progress. The dungeons are proceedurly generated which does help keep the layouts fresh, but the background art just looks so dull and samey after a while.\r\n\r\nThe major issue for me though is the lack of item descriptions before you pick something up. Once you do pick up something you do get clear descriptions but only once its picked up. This would usually be fine, but the game is constantly making you have to choose between 2 items whether it be in treasure rooms or at the merchants shop. I guess the intent is for you to experiment and familirize yourself with items just by looking at them, but I'm just not into that. Every time I encountered items I was not about to waste gold on something or pick up something at the cost of another, just on pure luck of the draw. I ended up just googling the items to find out what they did, and it got tedious after a while. You can unlock a character later that can see item descriptions before picking them up, but he has a major downside that makes him harder to play with. I shouldn't be punished or forced to play as one specific character just to see item descriptions. I know some roguelites do that, but there are plenty of ones like Slay the Spire that don't and I prefer the latter.",

The game has a great OST, great level designs, and a huge variety of weapons and masks that create multiple playstyles all drove by a 80s aesthetic.

          "content": "A fast-paced game packed with violence and gore, Hotline Miami is about a man who receives mysterious calls that tell him to commit massacres at specific places. The player can use a wide array of weapons that classify as melee, firearms, or throwables. They can even throw melee weapons and guns at enemies to kill or knock them down. It takes only one attack to kill you, so you should be quick and strategic as you kill all the enemies to progress. The gameplay is unique and fun while also being challenging. The story is okay at best, but that's fine because the main focus of this game is the gameplay. Overall, Hotline Miami is a fast and violent game for people who want a challenge filled with destructive mayhem.",

At times it can be a bit frustrating but the quick reset makes it super easy to jump back in the action after you die- which will happen a lot! The story is gritty and the setting is trippy.

          "content": "I would describe Hotline Miami as one of those games where everything fits perfectly, even the title. What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear \u201cHotline Miami\u201d? Neon lights, narcotics, crime - that's what this game is about. A drug fuelled slather with no rational motive or purpose. The gameplay manages to match this energy, thus leading to the cult status that Hotline Miami has obtained. \nI would recommend it to anyone who wants a fast-paced game within a setting rarely seen in gaming. The game is short, however it does make up for it with its replay value.\n\nStory\nYou play as a guy who took just the right drugs to turn into a killing machine. Now you receive orders from wherever, that decide which crime den you will assault next.\nI was quite invested in the story, more so for finding out what will happen next than anything else, but I can't say I was disappointed.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nThe gameplay loop is simple - enter a level, pick a mask, kill everyone.\nThis is deceptively simple, most enemies are either incapacitated or killed in one hit, but so are you. This leads to some very intense fights as you try to kill all enemies before they get a shot off. \nIn terms of replay value at the end of every encounter, you get points depending on how fast and stylish you were. A lot of time can be spent trying to figure out what's the most lethal route you can take in every level. I would recommend it if you have the reaction time.\n\nGraphics and artstyle\nTop down 2D and quite simplistic, but it conveys what it has to. \nA lot of effort has been put into presenting the \u201cvibe\u201d of the game through the artstyle. This can be seen in the use of bright colours and trippy visuals.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion  \nAs I said - a bloody drug induced trance. It pulls it off incredibly well, there is no mechanic or part that detracts from it. \nIt's hard to say I was immersed, it would be more correct to say I was invested.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe OST matches the intensity of the combat and the hazy hangover-like levels in-between the action. Personally not my type of music, but there is hardly anything better for a game like this. My favourite part of the soundtrack is \u201cCrystals\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhy the long face?\n",

          "content": "The turn-based strategy genre blows my mind (XCOM super fan) and this Mechanicus does not disappoint. He has good ideas, his own personality and I love how it reflects 40k.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the story is nothing special, but the conversations of the subdominus are entertaining. In addition, the setting is so well achieved that everything around you helps to get you into the world of 40k.\r\n\r\nIn the other hand, combat mechanics are good. You have different disciplines for each techpriest with a lot of options and Augment equipment for your characters, Additionally, you can discover guns or some objects in your run through the tombs, that you can equipt later.\r\n\r\nWith all of that in combat u can do a lot of actions, depending on your wepons, equipment and discipline of your techpriest. This disciplines have different passives for each character, and let you do some different actions in combat like buff damage for your wepons or more deffense for your team.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can have troops too, which I find very interesting and without a doubt a great success, cause they add more strategy to the game. They can be uplocked in missions, and in the same way u can upgrade them through the game. We have different types of this troops and with more game difficult, the more you need to choose wisely this characters and know when to use them.\r\n\r\nThey way you can get weapons, or upgrades for your troops, is doing missions for the subdominus, a mechanic so gratefull cause u can choose what mission, and for who, u want to do, with differents regards that can change entire game for you in the next battle.\r\n\r\nThe awakening mechanic is also interesting. It gives you a purpose with a time limit that is in line with your mission and adds a plus of difficulty to the game in general.\r\n\r\nLike i said, i loved this game, and his try to not simply copy/paste the XCOM franchise. Developers tried here to give his own personality and they did it. Game is so fun and you have to learn things to play good in this 40k world.\r\n\r\nRecommended. 8/10\r\n\r\nRegards.",

Explore the ruins of Blackstone, make your way through dark and dangerous caves, solve devilish puzzles, and make your way to an exciting conclusion.  Dare you come face to face with The Beast Inside?\n\nThe Beast Inside mixes a fascinating story with a survival horror experience which I found engaging and interesting throughout the entire game.  The world was stunning, the tale remarkable, and the action was quite gripping\u2014all leaving a pleasant taste in my mouth well after the end credits rolled.\n\nThe landscape of The Beast Inside looks like an open world but it really is not.  The lush and highly detailed world has paths that you must follow with fences, fallen trees, or other obstacles preventing you from straying too far.  However, for this type of game I did not see it as a detriment and there is still plenty of the dangerous and beautifully crafted decrepit woodlands and ruins to explore.\n\nThe voice acting is well done and the music and background sound really helped set the tone of the story.  Additionally, the amount of darkness in The Beast Inside made the game atmospherically perfect when coupled with a dwindling supply of oil for your lamp as your only source of light.\n\nAs a note, if you are a completionist and working on getting all of the achievements\u2019 you will need to play this game at least four times so as to get all four of the different story endings.  This was the only drawback to the achievement system that I experienced since both the automatic storyline and the secondary achievements were relatively easy and fun to get and gave me a real sense of accomplishment.  Additionally this game has some severe jump scenes, some of which still got me even on the fourth and final playthrough.\n\nThe Beast Inside is an exciting take on thriller and survival horror with very few drawbacks.  Overall, I enjoyed the game and would recommend it to those interested in horror games with a splash of deviously devilish puzzles to solve while you engage in a terrifying journey into horror.",

Theres a decent variety of enemies and rooms. \nThe game looks and sounds great. Nice pixel art and retro aesthetic. \nMy main issue with the game was just that I found it really hard. I hardly ever play these kind of games so had a steep learning curve and it definitely felt like a bit of a grind at times. ",

          "content": "This game is a great update to the original Pac-Man formula. It has 100 unique levels, 3 unique enemy types and several items with different effects. It's good for single or multiplayer gaming. But it's hard. The enemies move a little too fast, and some enemies are a little to effective for casual play. This makes the levels, which are often design as a basic puzzle, very hard to complete. Since you start with very few lives shared among all players game overs are common.\r\n\r\nThere are several sections to the game, each with a number of levels. But if you get a game over, you must restart from the beginning of that section with 4 lives, making progress very hard. This is especially true when playing co-op. I reached out to the developer and suggested he add casual and beginner modes to make it easier to play with casual friends. He seemed to think this was a great idea and implied he was working on it.\r\n\r\nIt's a very hard game and good for seasoned gamers to play single player.\r\n\r\nThe versus mode is also a lot of fun, where you chase down your friends. You cannot camp on the last gold coins since the game timeouts and give the victory to the treasure hunters. It's funt and frantic.",

I don't really like extinguish fire but after playing it with friends and advancing beyond the 1st level, I realized that I had found a rare diamond. Each level has 5 additional game modes+there are additional tasks that are available in all these modes, which creates an incredible replayability for the game, for completing tasks you get money, coins and diamonds that you can spend on really interesting equipment. Embr is an example of just a perfect grind game. I bought 4 copies and played with a bunch of friends, I got a lot of fun, and there is also a plot in the game, the locations are always surprising with something, they are interesting to study, a lot of hidden bonuses at the levels, the game is made from the heart, despite its primitiveness. There are, of course, small drawbacks, such as the weak design of the game, which do not allow to rate 10/10, I complete 2 areas on 100% for about 35 hours and I wanted more, but 3 district became a disappointment for me, the authors could not do better than the second masterpiece district and 3rd turned out to be quite average, 2 levels with a rate of 6/10 for me, 1 level - 7.5 and 1 - 7, final mission and ending..also 6/10. Only the third district does not allow me to rate the game 9/10.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curator`s page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\n\n/\n\u042d\u043c, \u043d\u0443

          "content": "I don\u2019t know what I was expecting. The well-worn pun in the title should have tipped me off that Dust: An Elysian Tail wasn\u2019t going to be a work of narrative excellence. Still, when the first five minutes, the poor plotting and terrible voice acting knocked me back. It\u2019s a problem that the astounding visuals exacerbate. When something looks this beautiful, it makes every flaw more readily apparent.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail is a side-scrolling combo-based action game. If you\u2019ve played Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii, then you should know exactly what to expect. The developer lifted most of the game\u2019s structure directly from that Vanillaware-developed title. Dust, the hero in An Elysian Tail, is capable of 1,000-hit combos. Each level is a series of connected arenas, and the overworld map allows you to select your next destination in whichever order you choose. Non-player characters who provide Dust with information and quests reside in peaceful towns. All of these design decisions are implemented almost exactly as they are in Muramasa.\n\nNot that there\u2019s anything wrong with an indie game taking a familiar formula and expanding on it. Unfortunately, that\u2019s where developer Humble Hearts fails. Dust: An Elysian Tail is a beautiful but poorly paced mess with eye-roll-inducing voice acting and dialog.\n\nDust: An Elysian Tail more combat\n\nWHAT YOU\u2019LL LIKE\n\nHyper-smooth animation and gorgeous visuals\nFrom a technical standpoint, Dust is possibly the best looking XBLA game. The animation has a buttery-smooth quality that surpasses just about anything Cartoon Network is airing on Saturday mornings. The characters and enemies move with a fluidity that gives the undertaking a mesmerizing swirl that is difficult to look away from.\n\nThe sprite work and background art are both highly detailed and crisp looking. This is incredibly important when the action gets especially frantic. Despite dozens of enemies, scores of projectiles, and hundreds of melee hits all simultaneously flying around the screen, the action is still discernible thanks to the polished graphics.\n\nA fun, high-energy combat system\nStabbing, slicing, and electrocuting is Dust\u2019s bread and butter. The game is never better than when you have a fully powered-up protagonist taking on legions of sword fodder. Deftly switching back and forth from direct-combat melee attacks to projectile assaults with the help of Dust\u2019s sidekick character Fidget looks and feels very cool.\n\nHumble Hearts instills a bit of strategy by forcing players to keep an eye on a single meter that multiple skills communally draw from. Too many indirect attacks will wipe out the meter quickly. To replenish it, Dust must successfully land a handful of sword strikes. The dodge move also relies on that same meter. Going into a battle without the ability to dodge increases the likelihood of a negative outcome for the player.\n\nIt\u2019s a constant game of balancing attacks. A variety of moves is especially important if you want to get 1,000-plus hit combos which is kinda the whole point of Dust.\n\nWHAT YOU WON\u2019T LIKE\n\nAbsurd voice acting, silly narrative tropes, and questionable character design\nIn the opening moments of the experience, the protagonist discovers he has amnesia, he gets a magical sword, and he acquires a wise-ass sidekick. It all occurs because that\u2019s just what happens in these games. That\u2019s enough for the developer, and the developer assumes it\u2019s enough for the player.\n\nFidget, Dust\u2019s flying nimbat (a mix between a cat and a bat) cohort, has a shrill voice that takes a while to get used to. Dust, meanwhile, speaks with that common-in-games inflection of a teenager who is wise beyond his years. It\u2019s not annoying to listen to, but it did make me roll my eyes. Although, that is nothing compared to some of the townsfolk, who all speak in wildly random cultural accents. The first town had characters that spoke with Australian, Italian, and eastern-European twangs.\n\nI could forgive a lot of that if the story was worth giving a damn about, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a standard hero\u2019s journey. Most story beats are very obvious and swamped in melodrama. Spoiler warning: If you meet someone who is ill in a town with a graveyard\u2026well, you probably know how that quest ends.\n\nThe look of the characters is very hit and miss. Everyone in the game is either an anthropomorphic mouse-rabbit-type thingy or lizard. Dust looks cool with his shrouded face and blue, wavy clothing, but I was off-put by Fidget\u2019s design. She has wide hips and an unnatural bustline that gives me the willies. I understand some people are into that (and I\u2019m not judging), but it just made me uncomfortable. A lot of the friendly cast looks like Care Bear rejects. At least most of the enemies \u2014 outside of the common grunt types \u2014 have an interesting and sinister look.\n\nBoring exploration, frustrating platforming, and broken pacing\nAs fun as the combat is, it buckles under long spells. It\u2019s great in short bursts but fighting enemies is not something I wanted to do for an hour straight. It doesn\u2019t have enough variety, so it gets very repetitive. Humble Hearts realized this and attempted to break up the combat sections with exploration, platforming, and challenge arenas.\n\nThis is where the game comes unglued. The exploration is boring. As Dust collects more abilities, he has the ability to find more secrets. It\u2019s something that props up an entire genre of Metroids and Castlevanias, but it doesn\u2019t have the same effect here. Where Super Metroid feels exquisitely planned out, Dust\u2019s exploration feels slapped together. I was never proud of myself for figuring out where something was, I simply went through the dull motions.\n\nThe platforming is something that suffers in comparison to the combat. When the protagonist really gets going with his attacks, he zooms across the screen like a locomotive. It feels magical. Jumping over spikes, on the other hand, feels inaccurate and silly \u2014 especially when those spikes can cause such massive damage.\n\nIt\u2019s all very boring, and it destroys the pacing.",

          "content": "A 10hour platformer which is not groundbreaking in any aspect, but still is pretty enjoyable, especially if you like easy games to relax with your gamepad. You follow around a dude with the classic case of amnesia, with a classic funny gimicky companion while doing classic jump and attack stuff.\nThe story is decent, while it is kind of childish (it does seem like a game is geared toward the younger audience, there is not much text in game, the quests are straightforward, even the \"hidden/secret\" puzzles are extremely basic, and most of the time are just solved by getting further in the story and getting that upgrade to your jump that you were missing)\nThe fighting system is responsive and fun, though it is pretty basic by most standards, there are basically 3 types of attack + 3 projectile attacks and 2 combos. That's it. The timings are forgiving, the opponents are mostly tank-n-spank with some variations.\nThere is leveling and equipment system in place, which is robust enough for a platformer game, still in itself it is again very simple at it's core (items do not posess much unique qualities, if the armour costs more and was found later in the game it gives more defence and is straight up better, same for the rest of the items.) There are crafting materials and crafting, though to craft highest end stuff in the end of the game - you actually have to grind materials (which I wouldn't expect to find in a platformer and was never inclined to do so)\nThe art in the game is awesome, characters are monsters have decent design effort put into them, though most of the time the designs were reused throughout the game, which is not that great for such a short game anyway.\n\nAll in all I don't think I personally would recommend this game over, say, Guacamelee. But it is still quite ok if you liked what you have read.\n\nPS. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 unskippable credits at the end of the game so hard.",

But once I switched to Novice, I actually started to have fun; the game still requires some hard moves, but now there are so many checkpoints, you feel you are facing only one challenge at a time. I was still missing too many tricky double jumps, but a little persistence got me to \"The End?\".\r\n\r\nThing is, the game has directional controls, a \"jump\" button and an \"action\" button -- that's it. The action button may attack, or dash, or dash-attack, or kick to the side, or kick upwards, or kick-flip a switch, all depending on how long you hold the button AND what direction you are going. At first, I cursed this design, often trying to attack an enemy but instead dashing towards deadly spikes... But going into \"Novice\", I learned to appreciate its elegance -- once you get used to the controls, you barely move your fingers around, and the game gets into a nice flow of its own. I imagine that good players will be able to pull amazing sequences on Standard, thanks to this.\r\n\r\nAlso, the pixel art between levels is lovely, cute and creepy all at once. The cutscenes manage to tell the (simple) story with nearly no words.\r\n\r\nPity that the game seems to lock one whole chapter and some sort of true ending behind the Standard difficulty (on Novice, the last screen literally said \"The End?\")... but that's a reward for players more skilled than me. :D\r\n\r\nAnyway, a fun platformer, even if quite hard.

          "content": "Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan is an absolute gem, especially in this day and age. \n\nThe game is a creature collection game where you have to bring back colour to the creatures and the world by confronting them, aka talking the critters through their anxieties and other often mental health related situations. Later on you'll deepen your friendship through gifts and more talking to hash out whatever they're going through.\n\nThe topics are very varied, there's some bullying (from both a bullies perspective and a victims), an artists anxiety about creating the best they can to be remembered, a prankster needing to learn the difference between a good prank and truly hurting others, break-up guilt, depression, lgbtqia+ matters.. There's definitely something for everyone's struggles in here and the way these are handled in conversation options and the way Billy talks through them is fantastic. \n\nThe game is very accessible to kids as a form of learning empathy, to deal with grief, to put ones struggles into words and more, so I'd definitely consider showing it to a young one. As an adult many of the topics may hit harder due to having gone through a lot of them oneself, but the game never really leaves a comfortable space in how the themes are explored. There's also a good amount of humour and, well, colour and cute visuals to balance out heavier moments. All in all, it's a great feel-good game.",

          "content": ", from former devs of Sonic games, which, in principle, is visible to the naked eye, as well as a strong emphasis under the \u201cSwitch\u201d console, which is why you will always see pixels in objects that are slightly at a distance (e.g. it`s difficult to distinguish water from the blue earth's surface), in short - technically they decided not to finish the game for \"large devices\", but okay, these are all complaints against the terrible publisher - 2K, which for some reason made a subsidiary publisher of platformers, but do not give them any promotion,potential indie hits remain unnoticed at the bottom of Steam,\r\nAnd like the previous \u201cRollerdrome\u201d from Private Division, this game deserves your attention, If you like short arcade levels that you can replay to find 3 \u201ccoins\u201d, for which you can open secret tasks for 1 minute of gameplay, or, complete 3 simple extra tasks from characters - they are almost always on your way and most often it\u2019s just to brimng something with a timer, collecting all the ordinary coins that fall out of boxes is pointless, because with them you can buy only 4 consumables, and each in 1 quantity, for example - fall protection, this is done so that it is impossible to be reborn without losing points 2 times for 1 level (you can\u2019t die, you just lose all points), but byw there is a small bug with this - consumables may not be purchased, and you have to buy it before each level,\r\nIn general, the game is very unfriendly to exploration, the world is not particularly detailed, as soon as you stop, you often run the risk of being caught by the local police - penguins, who begin to stick to you more and more until they put you in a net,\r\nAnd instead of finding a secret place, you are more likely to fall into a cliff or go to a place where there is nothing, because the authors forgot to put up an invisible wall, and the neural network could have generated the replicas of the people living here,\r\nYou can use our \u201cyo-yo\u201d to hit the same penguins or boxes, rotating it in any direction or around you, there are all sorts of \u201cpower-ups\u201d when our toy (by the way, it\u2019s alive) turns into a huge ball, or stretches behind a palm tree to make a long jump, or is used as a boat, but these mechanics are not enough, at the end of the any level there is a small \"qte game\" that gives extra points.\r\nThe plot set-up is cartoonishly cool, but the whole script consists of only 2 lines, and the world doesn\u2019t provide enough lore to \u201cbelieve\u201d in it,\r\nThis is why the levels lack visual variety;; I only remember the water locations,\r\nAnd the bosses are visually just the opposite: it`s funny, easy, perhaps even too much, not deep, but not stressful.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude0a \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddef \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude06

Being a game that focused on LGBT matters meant this game was going to get praise from one side and be absolutely smashed by the other. \"It's a walking simulator,\" said critics. Yeah, you do a lot of walking in this game but that's because it's simply an exploratory experience. The player character has just come home from studying abroad and her family has moved into a large inherited house. Your sister should be there but she isn't and as you progress through the game you'll uncover the truth behind her disappearance. I know that sounds like a true crime sort of thing but Gone Home is anything but. There's no grisly murder and despite the eerie atmosphere of the game there are no monsters or jump scares whatsoever. It's safe to just relax and get lost in the minutia of this world. The more you explore the more you'll uncover about the plot through letters your sister has written for you. It's important to be thorough while exploring the house because it's full of props and mementos that further explain the story alongside the completely separate B-plot as to why your parents aren't home either. Gone Home tells a story in a manner unlike any other game out there and it's a story worth experiencing.",

          "content": "I really enjoyed Still There. It was an interesting concept to just be thrown into the game with almost 0 idea of where you are or why. Purely in that I didn't think there was much of a story or background explanation given at the start. Unless there was and I was just blind to it but I don't remember there being any real proper setting the scene. Being made to do work in a game was... interesting XD And the cocky, sarcastic computer companion was very funny to deal with but still not as awesome as the little lizard friend! It felt very technical, though maybe that's because I kept forgetting to open up the manual to try and decipher what I might need to do (sounds like me). It is a LOT of buttons/knobs to control and it looks very overwhelming. Definitely a puzzling aspect to the game. I'm still not 100% certain why the only process where each step was explained to you every single time was making water, I don't need you to tell me what to do with the pee every time XD There were definitely some... questionable.... items included in the game seemingly just for the lols. Which is fine and it kinda linked into the story (in the time before you were here) but still seemed like it was just added because the devs could. The storyline does eventually develop more and you do start to learn why you're there, where you are, and your sad back story that led you to this point. The game does smack you in the face at the end with the final piece of your backstory so be aware of that but overall the story development was good. The art was great and the music was alright too. Would play again, will likely go achievement hunting to finish it off.",

It takes a some great elements of JRPG and give them a western touch to keep things fresh! While it can be a bit grindy (that's the jrpg part..) making the whole thing feel like a tabletop/boardgame was really neat for me. Switching constantly between the various 'modes' (Worldmap, dungeon crawling, and fights) really kept things fresh.\r\n\r\nSadly i didn't finish it, mostly because the story really didn't keep me too engaged. The artstyle and animation at top notch, but the world and story felt pretty cliche and unoriginal. Nothing really terrible mind you, but i wouldn't put it as one of the main point of praise. \r\n\r\nFighting mechanics were pretty clever, and quickly becomes challenging. Each character does feel very unique with their abilities and you end up having to try specifics ways of using each of them, love the strategic aspects of some tougher fights. ",

          "content": "STALKER: Clear sky is the second in the STALKER trilogy and a prequel to Shadow of Chernobyl. Honestly, and many will agree with me, this is the weakest in the series. It\u2019s a rehash of the previous game with slightly better graphics, some new areas and a new but worse story. Still the core of STALKER is there so I can\u2019t call it bad, it\u2019s just mid. It\u2019s not required to play to be able to understand the next game. I would only recommend it to anyone who just wants more STALKER.\n\nStory \nSame setting as the previous game with only minimal differences. The story itself is worse. \nYou are part of an organisation trying to stop people from going to the centre of the zone in the guise of - very bad things will happen. It\u2019s mostly just doing the same as in SoC, but without the magic of experiencing it for the first time.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nGameplay wise there are multiple improvements, but it\u2019s overshadowed by the next game in the series, Call of Pripyat, that does everything even better. \nMy biggest problem is that 80% of the map is the same. Playing this right after SoC makes both blur together. It could have been used to good effect if the storyline was better, but it isn\u2019t so.\nThere is one thing I wasn\u2019t included in the next title - faction warfare. It was in SoC, but it didn\u2019t have much depth. Here you can join your faction of choice and fight for them, even taking territory. I wasn\u2019t interested in it, so ignored it, however if you do want to spice up your playthrough, consider it.\n\nGraphics \nImproved compared to the previous title. I mainly remember the lighting being better. \n\nAtmosphere/Immersion\nEven with all the criticism I dished out, I was still mostly immersed in the world of Clear Sky. So I can\u2019t say anything bad about the atmosphere, it has even improved in some parts.\n\nMusic \nThese games share many of the songs in their soundtracks. They are almost exclusively dark ambience. Clear Sky does have exclusive songs in each of the faction bases, the bandit radio being very popular to the point where I had no idea it was even from Clear Sky. My favourite is \u201cLoner Radio\u201d.\n\nFinal thoughts \nEver heard that very popular \u201cCyka blyat\u201d sound bite, I believe it comes from this game, or at the very least from the STALKER series.",

          "content": "Gameplay wise this game plays like any classic survival horror game, taking cues from both Resident Evil and Silent Hill. You have a fairly large weapon line up, with a pistol, shotgun, revolver, flare gun (that can also use grenade shells as ammo), rifle and sub machine gun. I honestly just expected a pistol, shotgun and revolver but this game really over delivered on its weapons line up and I love it. However, you also get a list of secondary items you can equip like a stun prod (which is basically like a defensive knife), thermite flares you can use to burn enemy corpses, so they don't come back (very RE1 remake), a flashlight etc.. I like that the game gives you so many options and the tools to deal with the threats. Combat uses a twin stick shooter system, which I hate playing on controllers in general, but on keyboard and mouse its very accurate and responsive. Overall, I liked the combat and the game has enough enemy variety that you often can't guess what will be waiting for you in the next room.\r\n\r\nPuzzle wise, this game actually has some really good puzzles. Very old school in their design, but none of them felt obscure and hard to solve. They also include a radio in this game, but unlike in Silent Hill where its used to detect enemies, in this game you use it to solve many of the puzzles by listening to certain frequencies. I thought it was a clever integration of the radio and there's even a specific enemy type that you need the radio to fight, which I thought was cool, although those enemies did get annoying after a while.\r\n\r\nSound design is also perfect from the monsters making very unsettling noises down to the sounds the weapons make, as they sound very punchy when you fire them which adds to the satisfaction. The music is also amazing, with some very melancholic tracks that reminded me of Silent Hill, while still doing its own thing. This all adds to the games incredible atmosphere that really makes you feel isolated on this desolate planet.\r\n\r\nAs for horror, this game doesn't try as hard to scare you with jump scares or anything like that. The atmosphere does help the game, but I never felt as scared as I did playing games like Darkwood or Lost In Vivo where even an abandoned subway station scared the hell out of me, despite not much happening. The gore is used very well in this game as the mixture of anime and a PS1 art style adds to the unsettling nature of it, but its never over done that you become desensitised to it. The cut-scenes also use a lot of unsettling imagery that I will talk about more later. Overall the game has a good atmosphere and some good scares, but it wasn't as well done as I would have liked.\r\n\r\nThe story though was just beautiful. Its done in a very minimal way, as most cut scenes last less then 30 seconds, but its the imagery they use that communicates a lot without saying much. Its got a very European art house film style to it which I liked with a lot of German language and imagery, which connected with me personally, since I studied both German language and history in high school. There's also plenty of notes scattered around for you to read that does a lot of world building about the different Replika units you encounter and the setting they live in. However, these notes are vital to read to understand characters backstories and motivations as they don't outright tell you in cut scenes. There is no voice acting aside for some audio on the radio that's in German, but honestly the story was still very effective and I don't feel like it really needed voice acting to tell it.\r\n\r\nAs for complaints, I don't have that many really. I originally had issues with the inventory managment but the devs have since patched most of these issues out giving players more options of how they want to play. So that takes care of all my complaints really. ",

The story is something akin to an H.P. Lovecraft short mixed with a little bit of Dead Space.\n\nI had some issues with gameplay. Text can be extremely hard to read and this can make your ammo situation harder. Sometimes I'd have difficulty aiming at an enemy if there were multiple in a room. There were moments where the game emptied my inventory before a boss fight and I wasn't aware, so I entered a boss fight without a gun. \n\nThe story is intentionally confusing. Without getting into spoilers the entire game is a mess of connected events and distorted reality. Even after the game ended I was confused as to what I just witnessed. There are 5 endings in total that help shape the narrative but unfortunately I don't feel motivated enough to play through this that many times.",

A lot of choice-based games are criticized for choice not really mattering, and with this one, you can't really say that is the case. In contrast to another Wales Interactive FMV creation Late Shift, this feels more like a game than a film, and that is certainly good. However, after playing I couldn't have shaken off a feeling that the whole thing had no satisfying ending. It just kind of ends. Considering that modern FMV games are still being figured out, I can still absolutely recommend Five Dates as a fun Friday night thing, though.",

          "content": "It is so great to see a game about depression that doesnt involve running away from a shadow momster then destroying it at the end. I think the theme of depression and self acceptance is explored with a lot of nuance here. There characters are really empathetic and well rounded which helps sell the plot.\nThe gameplay is feels great. Its got a fairly simple movement system but which still has a lot of depth and seemingly exponential difficulty and replay value. \nThe visual style of the game is a lovely pixel art aesthetic and some of the mountain vistas in it are seriously beautiful. Theres a few sections with a lot of repeating textures which looks pretty bad but overall very nice.\nThere were two points in the game that I really did not enjoy, one was called the mirror temple and the other is the games only boss battle. Both of these jsut dragged on and on and involved some combat (ish) mechanics that didn't suit the game at all. While the change of pace is probably necessary, this was really the wrong way to do it and not only put me off playing the game further after the credits rolled but massively blunted the sense of accomplishement and attatchment to the story as I progressed further and finished the climb up the mountain. \nAll said it's a really unique game with a powerful message behind it, excellent gameplay and art, but with a couple of sections that soured the experience ever so slightly.",

For many people, it will hit incredibly close to home. Even if it doesn't, it will give the player a strong sense of motivation and positivity.\n\nThe soundtrack, of course, is one of the best video game soundtracks ever created.

The soundtrack is great. Gameplay-wise, it's nothing out of this world and I found it tedious at several points. At first, I was motivated to collect the secondary collectibles, but after a while, I stopped because it seemed like a waste of time to me.\n In summary, this game stands out for its message about the protagonist's mental state and her way of making peace with herself.",

But in the story locations, they don\u2019t feel any danger, they just growl intimidatingly in one place, while you can wander around for at least an hour and look for what needs to be done. We generally calmly kill small dinosaurs with our fists, we could at least shoot from a machine gun, and there are characters with a firearm, but they are not given at locations where you need to fight, they only need to shoot at targets. You can also ride cars in the open world.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curator`s page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

Some of these puzzles were far too obscure and just unsatisfying to solve because I found the solution by chance or trial and error. The game looks pretty good but definitely nothing impressive. The voice acting was well done. The story was really interesting, it revolves around artificial intelligence and one robot's quest to save its master, but it is short and doesn't show off much variety. The story that was there was entertaining and some of the writing made me laugh out loud. Well worth a play.",

With an amazing artstyle, good story and an incredibly satisfying gameplay loop it is a game you should definitely pick up.  \nStory\nYou are an insurance investigator tasked with finding out what happened to the crew of the ship Obra Dinn, with the help of a magic watch that shows the last moments of someone's life. Because of this you play the role of an observer looking at all of the trials and tribulations that the ship went through. They are told to you in a non-linear manner, oftentimes you will see the end of a chapter before the beginning. This might seem confusing, but due to this being a detective game you will always be paying close attention to whatever is happening.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay consists mainly of figuring out the fates of the crew (what was their name, how did they die). This is done perfectly with almost no hand holding allowing you to fail endlessly. It might seem like this would just end with frustration, however the game gives you enough clues to figure out the fate of everyone. Also the \u201cAha\u201d feeling of finally figuring out the fate of someone, through a series of deduction and exemption, is unmatched by anything.\nGraphics\nDon't be put off by its black and white aesthetic, this is a very beautiful game. Paying homage to older video games while also looking like it was made in this decade is pulled off perfectly here. Never was I confused or missed something because it was in the shadows. Also great sound effects and voice acting.\nSoundtrack\nNice classical music that fits with the aesthetic of the rest of the game.\nFinal Thoughts\nSome of the most entertaining 8 hours of my life. Lucas Pope can make games like this one until the end of time and I will be there to play every one of them.\n\n",

It is my favorite of the whole franchise: good levels, good gameplay, the characters are still well characterized and maintain that charisma, in addition to very good soundtrack. Due to his difficulty he is the best to start in the franchise, although Pirate`s Curse (8.5 / 10) did some things better like: a better story to tell us the past of Risky and Rottytops, see Shantae and Risky collaborate together and The well-designed Dungeons, unlike the Half Genie Hero where there is no right, so I consider Pirate`s Curse the best of the series, and Half Genie Hero the second best.",

          "content": "Wandersong is about spreading happiness and love and getting to see the best side of people (and animals, and monsters) whenever possible. The main character (\"the bard\") isn't a hero, but just someone who wants to make people's lives better mostly through the use of music -- and, hey, maybe saving the world, since this might make people happier too. Actually, the game makes a point that \"heroes\" aren't always the nicest people, or whom you should strive to be.\n\nThe game is infused with cuteness and uplifting moments, but it is not a sugar fest -- there are negative events, there is war, there is decay and maybe the impending end of the world. The most important characters are full of self doubt and fear of not-fitting, so the game seems to imply that these are common and natural feelings, and what matters is what you make of them. But the bard reacts to all of it always expecting (naively?) the best of others, and it works.\n\nGameplay has two \"modes\" -- walking around town, talking to tons of people and solving light quests; and a few more \"platformy\" sections, almost all based on some music mechanic, but all of them sharing the same control (right joystick to select 1 out of 8 possible notes). Though most of the music mechanics have to be figured out as the game goes, absolutely no music knowledge is necessary, everything can be solved by experimentation and observation of how the surroundings react to your moves. Death is never a problem -- when it happens, you restart almost instantly pretty much right before you died.\n\nI also loved how often the game twists videogame expectations -- you may or may not be \"The Hero\"; you cannot even handle a sword; you are not supposed to kill all bad monsters in sight; sometimes your actions do not produce the expected results; and a few other clich\u00e9s (even achievements!) are subverted like this.\n\nAll in all, if you spend your time to know the vast character ensemble, this is a 10-12h game which is sure to inject a hopeful smile into your heart.\n\nScore: 88/100.",

Otherwise - again - it's just not fun.\n\nI write it, because you can find many reviews that praise the game for a lot of things, but failed to conclude that in the end - the games have to bring you joy and this one doesn't (at least for me).",

This works surprisingly well and makes you consider strategies completely differently than you would with a simple health bar. It's implemented in a way that makes it super intuitive to reverse time to certain points after being hit. The sword moves, as well, are intuitive and easy to understand.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is also a point where it stands out. Cogen is a super hard game. Normal difficulty is so hard that about halfway through the game it recommends turning down to casual right before it ramps up even higher. My main issue is that there isn't really an in-between for Normal and Casual difficulty. Casual is a bit too easy with the buffs it gives you, and Normal is a bit too unforgiving after you are no longer able to regenerate time rewinds at that halfway point.\n\nThe boss fights are all put together very well. It feels incredibly satisfying to learn the boss' patterns and get better at fighting them.\n\nThe story, while a bit over-the-top sometimes and at other times generic, is pretty endearing, as are the characters. The voice acting is surprisingly good and characterization is very clear.\n\nOverall Score: 8/10",

          "content": "An amazing interactive noir story and RPG. The world is dripping with style, which is one of my favourite parts of the game. The RPG mechanics are excellent as well, allowing a variety of playthroughs and interactions that change depending on how you develop you character. The characters are excellent as well, with a few notable individuals who excel at showing complexity in terms of their ideology. \n\nAnd this game is all about ideology. The alt-universe world allows for completely new history, but grounds its politics and philosophy in real world ideas. You can be a communist and support a workers uprising, a pragmatist cop, a hedonistic libertarian, or a far-right fascist, and can mix and match these ideologies as well, leading to many different combinations of events, conversations and outcomes. \n\nThe ending of the game really got me as well; without spoiling, I felt a physical withdrawal from this world, and a part of me would have loved to see a longer game, although the game itself took me 30+ hours to playthrough.

Woke up, jumped on my fan to fringe my tie and died of a heart attack. \r\n10/10 would jump again.\r\n\r\nBut seriously though. The game offers an immense depth in the character development that takes place continuously while playing. The start attributes are not negligible, from my point of view it is not possible to maximize your character in every skill. Nevertheless, you get so many points that you make good progress. The great thing about it is that you actually notice how your character is changing and the environment is doing the same. The way in which you react to unconscious decisions is great.\r\nFor example, in one day I quickly ran everywhere and clicked my way through because I didn't have much time in RL. When I reloaded the game and ended the day ingame, someone made a snappish remark during a conversation to draw my attention to the fact that I am simply impatient.\r\nSuch things subconsciously give you a great feeling while playing and also some memorable moments.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place quite slowly and is very text-heavy, only a few (important) passages are actually voiced. You have to deal with that. \r\nActually such games aren't my favourite playground either, but this made me curious about the first trailer back then and I wasn't disappointed. I rate it a perfect 5 out of 7.\r\n\r\n",

En cuanto a las voces son incre\u00edbles, todas, no hay ninguna voz mala, todas representan bien las emociones, son identificables, hay personajes con hasta acentos diferentes y lo puedes notar y comentarlo, no es un \u201cmira este nuevo personaje es de una regi\u00f3n extranjera con una cultura y personas totalmente distinta y acaba de llegar pero habla exactamente como todos aqu\u00ed\u201d, puedes notar cuando alguien es extranjero, cuando esta feliz, decepcionado, cada personaje tiene su voz y su forma de hablar que los hacen identificables, no son muchos personajes pero considerando la cantidad de di\u00e1logos que tienen cada uno, el lograr tan buenas voces es algo destacable. Y  el soundtrack, es maravilloso, identificable, se me queda pegado en la cabeza el tema de will in rags, se siente verdadera emoci\u00f3n cuando estas teniendo un dialogo emotivo o tenso y la m\u00fasica lo acompa\u00f1a perfectamente, seg\u00fan donde est\u00e9s, o con quien est\u00e9s hablando la m\u00fasica cambia, se ajusta en el momento perfecto, no es una m\u00fasica altamente detallada y espectacular pero es la indicada, no te distraer\u00e1 de los momentos pero tampoco es tan olvidable como para que no la tomes en cuenta y puedas jugar con la m\u00fasica apagada, es el soundtrack adecuado, muy identificable, va con la est\u00e9tica del juego, se siente realmente como la m\u00fasica que escuchar\u00edas en este mundo distopico, remarca bien los sentimientos y da un muy buen ambiente.\r\n\r\nGameplay: Vamos por partes \r\n\r\n1 Los Controles y Como se juega: Disco Elysium es un juego de dialogo, aqu\u00ed vienes a hablar, se siente bien porque no es pulsar A todo el tiempo y que pasen los di\u00e1logos, es un rpg de mundo abierto, tienes que ir de un lugar a otro, puede que alguien con quien deseas hablar solo este a ciertas horas o en cierto lugar, puede que se te hizo muy tarde y las calles est\u00e1n vac\u00edas y no tienes donde quedarte a dormir porque te quedaste sin dinero, puede que tengas que caminar por varias partes para conseguir algo que buscas, El gameplay esta centrado en el dialogo pero tambi\u00e9n en la exploraci\u00f3n, en moverte por el mundo, que veas los escenarios y hables con las personas en su sitio. Todo esto se controla usando solo el mouse, es lo mas c\u00f3modo, puedes seleccionar mejor los di\u00e1logos, clickar por donde moverte, equiparte las cosas, todo esta f\u00e1cil y accesible, la interfaz donde ves tu equipamiento, tu inventario y tus aptitudes esta en un mismo lugar, compactada para no quitar mucho espacio y bien puesta para que sientas que realmente estas viendo tus voces internas tus ideas y lo que traes equipado, todo esta a una distancia prudente para poder ir dando clicks y movi\u00e9ndote, no hay muchos elementos y es un juego pausado, tienes que tomarte tu tiempo para leer, para caminar, para hablar, para ver cada cosa, es super c\u00f3modo de navegar, no es como Grim Dawn que supuestamente lo puedes jugar solo con el mouse pero tiene tantas cosas en pantalla que si no te mueves con el teclado vas a terminar es jugando osu de lo tanto que mueves el mouse por todos lados. Ya hablando de esto, Disco Elysium son solo di\u00e1logos, ya estamos acostumbrados a juegos que son puro texto, pero \u00bfcomo es que construimos una mec\u00e1nica alrededor de hablar con las personas en un mundo abierto? Pues de la siguiente manera\r\n\r\n2 Los Di\u00e1logos e Interacciones: puede resultar dif\u00edcil hacer interactivo juegos as\u00ed, varios se limitan a contarte la historia como va de forma muy lineal y al final parece que terminas viendo una pel\u00edcula, si las historias son muy buenas los recuerdas si no las olvidas, las mec\u00e1nicas aqu\u00ed suele ser ver di\u00e1logos y di\u00e1logos y al final tomar x o y decisi\u00f3n, Pero en Disco Elysium se torna diferente ya que estos di\u00e1logos influyen en el mundo, est\u00e1n bien detallados e hilados, no hay di\u00e1logos intrascendentes, todos nos cuentan informaci\u00f3n sobre el mundo, la trama, o las propias personas con las que hablamos, y estos di\u00e1logos son interactivos, seg\u00fan las cosas que digamos las personas pueden tener una imagen diferente de nosotros, nuestras palabras y acciones simples tambi\u00e9n pesan, no es solo llegar a un momento critico y tomar una decisi\u00f3n y hay el juego cambia, hay momentos as\u00ed pero tambi\u00e9n los peque\u00f1os di\u00e1logos o interacciones simples tambi\u00e9n influyen, si ayudas a cierta persona, al final del juego te lo remarcan y te dicen que hiciste trabajos para una persona de dudosa \u00e9tica, si tienes di\u00e1logos racistas, tu compa\u00f1ero que es un extranjero reacciona a estos y te los comenta, sin que sean di\u00e1logos vitales o algo como: \u201ceres racista o no eres racista\u201d, las decisiones que construyen tu personalidad no est\u00e1n tan a simple vista, las peque\u00f1as cosas tambi\u00e9n cuentan, por lo que tu al notarlo vas a pensar cada cosa que dices, ya no vas a hablar por hablar, te enfocas mas en tu rol porque al igual que en la vida real decir una estupidez a una persona puede afectar como esta te vez, cagarla es realmente cagarla, te construyes tu propia identidad a base de los di\u00e1logos que tu eliges y a base de las aptitudes que decidas subir, lo de las aptitudes ya lo tocare en dise\u00f1o pero en resumidas cuentas son las voces internas o aptitudes que nos pueden ayudar con ciertos di\u00e1logos, algo que note al rejugarlo, hay cierto personaje que oculta una cosa, si tienes la l\u00f3gica alta puedes notar que algo con el no encaja, la l\u00f3gica en tu mente te habla y te lo dice y ah\u00ed se desbloquea una tirada para intentar ver que oculta esa persona, y bueno cuando lo rejugue esa opci\u00f3n no salio porque no tenia la l\u00f3gica alta y mi personaje no se daba cuenta de eso, una peque\u00f1a variante hace que no te puedas dar cuenta de unas cosas pero si de otras, cambia totalmente la forma en que vez el mundo y juegas, te pierdes de algo pero vez otras cosas, adaptandote a un rol y sintiendo que tu personaje realmente tiene la personalidad y aptitudes que tu elegiste al inicio y elegiste subir, no es un espadach\u00edn que lleva usando espada largas durante todo el juego pero al final le equipas un arco y lo sabe usar a la perfecci\u00f3n, si es un pensador es un pensador, si tiene inteligencia emocional y empatia la tiene, siempre todo esta balanceado para que podamos percibir el mundo a nuestra manera. Y queda un poco mas, una cosa, claramente los di\u00e1logos, aptitudes y peque\u00f1as interacciones cuentan, pero \u00bfque hay de las grandes interacciones?, de las decisiones claras, Bueno aqu\u00ed no hay decisiones como tal si escoger entre A o B, seria mas entre A B C D E F, no es que escojas entre muchas opciones si no que cada dialogo y peque\u00f1a cosa cuenta para construir el camino que llevas y tambi\u00e9n influyen en las Tiradas, que son las tiradas, pues di\u00e1logos o acciones que podemos hacer y requieren de cierta aptitud, por ejemplo derrumbar una puerta, requiere de fuerza f\u00edsica, necesitamos tener esa aptitud alta no para poder hacerla si no para que salga bien, ya que estas tiradas van por probabilidades, mientras mayor sea la aptitud requerida mas probabilidades tenemos para que salga bien, y puede salir bien aun teniendo bajas probabilidades o mal teniendo un 60%, pero la aptitud no es lo \u00fanico que influye, si no tambi\u00e9n las interacciones por ejemplo, si recorremos la zona pesquera y despu\u00e9s invitamos a una persona que esta por ah\u00ed a dar un paseo, tendremos mas probabilidades de acertar esa tirada, ya que conocemos lugares por donde podemos llevarla a pasear, si observamos bien un grupo y notamos quien es el mas inseguro, tendremos mas probabilidades en la tirada de intentar manipular al grupo ya que conocemos cual es el eslab\u00f3n mas d\u00e9bil, y as\u00ed, muchas cosas pueden influir en las tiradas haciendo que sea mas org\u00e1nico y que no solo dependas de subir x habilidad, tambi\u00e9n puedes arriesgarte e intentarla teniendo probabilidades bajas porque no es raro que te salga bien, Y bueno hay 2 tiradas, las b\u00e1sicas que podemos ir repitiendo, y las criticas que una vez falladas no se pueden repetir y estas pueden cambiar el rumbo de una conversaci\u00f3n o de los acontecimientos, o desembocar en ciertas situaciones, por ejemplo al inicio cuando el camarero pregunta por su dinero sale una tirada critica que es intentar escabullirnos sin ser vistos, si falla saldremos corriendo torpemente y tropezaremos, chocando con una se\u00f1ora en silla de ruedas, a ra\u00edz de eso no le pasa nada a las se\u00f1ora pero nosotros quedamos tirados en el suelo y nos preguntan si estamos bien, podemos intentar pedirle disculpas a la se\u00f1ora y el camarero dice que lo siente que el hotel siempre ha ayudado a la MCR pero que igual le pagues, a ra\u00edz de fallar una tirada critica se desbloquea un situaci\u00f3n totalmente diferente, por lo que fallarlas o acertarlas no hace que nos perdamos de algo si no hace que la historia tome un rumbo distinto y en vez de repetir nos adaptamos a la situaci\u00f3n creada y vemos como resulta todo dej\u00e1ndonos llevar.\r\n\r\nTodos los di\u00e1logos y cosas interactuan entre si, se construye una buena historia atravez de peque\u00f1os y grandes detalles, al final el decir x cosa si afecta y hace que nos pensemos que diremos, genera tensi\u00f3n, y nos mantiene atentos y da mucho juego a simples di\u00e1logos que podr\u00edan parecer intrascendentes haciendo que todo en este juego tenga sustancia, cada peque\u00f1a historia cada cosa que digamos y cada acci\u00f3n que realicemos bien o mal influye en como el mundo nos percibe y nosotros a ellos. Y Aun quedan cosas por decir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDise\u00f1o: Vamos por partes igualmente\r\n\r\n1 las mec\u00e1nicas y porque funciona que sean simples: como dije hay voces y aptitudes que tenemos, est\u00e1n divididas en 4 reinos: intelecto, psique, composici\u00f3n y motricidad, al inicio del juego elegimos en que reino invertir nuestros puntos, los reinos mas bajos no podremos subir las aptitudes o voces de estos tan alto ya que el limite de cuanto puede establecer esta establecido por el nivel de el reino que determinamos al principio, aunque podemos hacer cosas para subirlos temporalmente. estas voces o aptitudes nos hablan, la empatia nos dice como se sienten las personas, la percepci\u00f3n nota cosas de nuestro entorno, Savvy nos incita a robar o a ser desafiantes, electroquimica quiere que consumamos alcohol o drogas, l\u00f3gica sirve para destapar cosas que se nos pueden pasar a simple vista. Todas las aptitudes son \u00fanicas pero no indispensables, \u201cpero para que pones algo si no va a hacer nada\u201d. La cuesti\u00f3n es que si hacen, solo que por tu manera de jugar esas voces no har\u00e1n nada, rejugando vi como cambiaban las cosas, las voces del reino de la l\u00f3gica ya no dec\u00edan nada pero las de la psique si, y me contaban cosas distintas, hacen que cambies tu percepci\u00f3n de las cosas, las habilidades que no suben no son pesos in\u00fatiles si no que est\u00e1n dormidas, puedes encontrar maneras de subirlas, yo con el reino de la psique en 1 me alegre para subir manipulaci\u00f3n al 7, Estas voces y aptitudes no son mas que un reflejo de lo que tu deseas, de el rol que estas tomando, si decides ser un pelionero poco empatico no vas a tener a empatia habl\u00e1ndote, si vas a ser un pensador que no puede ni levantar un bid\u00f3n de agua, no vas a tener forma f\u00edsica, todo esta distribuido para que juegues a tu manera y puedas adaptarte a un rol, puedes prescindir de ciertas cosas porque al hacerlo te abres el camino a algo nuevo y no son aptitudes o voces in\u00fatiles que est\u00e1n porque los desarrolladores no saben hacer cosas buenas, son cosas que puedes llevar o no y dependiendo de lo que hagas tu experiencia va a cambiar, Y no puedes chetarte, no puedes ponerte a hacer cosas para subir todo al m\u00e1ximo, los reinos est\u00e1n limitados por los puntos que elegiste al inicio, para subirlos consumes cosas que te da\u00f1an la moral o desembocan en nuevos di\u00e1logos, para subir de nivel y tener puntos de habilidad necesitas completar las tareas, tener ciertos di\u00e1logos, o otras cosas, las tareas se basan en hablar e involucrarte con el mundo por lo que subir de nivel no significa disociar durante 3 horas y ponerte en autom\u00e1tico a buscar cofres auto generados o matar los mismos enemigos repetidas veces haciendo que desconectes del juego, si no que el subir de nivel significa que te involucres aun mas en el mundo, que tomes tu papel que rolees que veas todas las cosas que estos di\u00e1logos tareas e interacciones te abren, y aun no he terminado con esto, podemos tener ciertas ventajas seg\u00fan las prendas que llevemos, la ropa nos da ventajas por ejemplo nos sube 1 de empatia, o nos da uno de l\u00f3gica, por lo que vas cambiando de atuendo y como todo es tan accesible y c\u00f3modo no es una tarea dif\u00edcil, puedes ir bien vestido para hablar con una mujer de negocios porque ese traje te daba l\u00f3gica, o puedes ir vestido como un vagabundo a tumbar una puerta porque ese traje te daba forma f\u00edsica, vamos que hasta la ropa que llevas se complementa con tu estilo de juego y personaje. Tambi\u00e9n tenemos un \u00e1rbol de ideas, las ideas vienen de pensamientos que podemos obtener, por ejemplo recogemos una envoltura de chicle, el olor nos recuerda a algo entonces sale la idea de el chicle que ol\u00eda a albaricoques, pones a desarrollar la idea durante una hora o lo que pida (se desarrolla de forma pasiva mientras juegas) y bueno despu\u00e9s de que se desarrolle te da la conclusi\u00f3n de la idea y una ventaja pasiva, y estas ideas nacen de interacciones o di\u00e1logos internos o con el mundo, tambi\u00e9n dependen de tus aptitudes por lo que alguien que no sabe de arte y no tiene la abstracci\u00f3n alta no podr\u00e1 desarrollar mi idea favorita que es la de estudiado de arte, que nace de  un dialogo en el cual hablas de la critica del arte y te pones a desarrollar la idea de que es ser un critico de arte (la cual tiene una conclusi\u00f3n graciosa ya que son puros insultos y degradaciones haciendo una mini critica a los cr\u00edticos de arte) , y esa idea te da +10 de experiencia cada que la voz de abstracci\u00f3n habla.\r\n\r\n2 Como el juego te lleva: el juego deja que tu descubras el mundo, que explores tu propio inter\u00e9s hasta donde llegue, y no es que es un juego dif\u00edcil, una misma situaci\u00f3n puede tener varias soluciones o salidas, y no depende de tu habilidad o si no de como juegues y tambi\u00e9n puede depender de tu suerte, vamos que no te quedaras trabado intentando a hacer x siempre hay una alternativa o puedes pasar de x cosas, puedes ir solo por la trama principal y no notar el desastre pol\u00edtico y social que hay, o puedes enfocarte en eso y olvidarte de investigar tu caso, o ponerte a buscar un insecto gigante con unos criptozoologos que te conseguiste. El juego no te gu\u00eda no te pone un marcador y te dice ve ah\u00ed y has esto porque te da dinero, ni siquiera hay un mapa tan interactivo, solo es un pedazo de papel que te dice la ubicaci\u00f3n de ciertas cosas, y es que el mapa es peque\u00f1o, lo suficiente para que te aprendas todos sus rincones y curiosidades, en cada esquina hay algo que hacer, no hay lugares que sean puro camino muerto meramente contemplativo, y ciertas partes del mapa est\u00e1n limitadas en un inicio (con una justificaci\u00f3n coherente) haciendo as\u00ed que te familiarices primero con una zona para des pues recorrer otra, algunos personajes o eventos no estar\u00e1n disponibles en cierto d\u00eda, por lo que te pondr\u00e1s en otra cosa, el juego administra muy bien su contenido para que no tengas 10000 cosas por hacer y 0 ganas de hacerlas porque es tiempo muerto para al final poder obtener una recompensa que no sabes si te va a satisfacer, si no que el juego va dejando sus tareas bien distribuidas para que no te pierdas y si te pierdes no pasa nada puedes pasar de varias de estas, para algunas tendr\u00e1s que esperar un d\u00eda, o solo la puedes hacer en un momento indicado porque claramente el mundo se mueve, no se queda esperando por ti pero tampoco va tan r\u00e1pido como para dejarte atr\u00e1s. \r\n\r\nTodo estos sistemas sumado al gameplay hacen la experiencia perfecta, la experiencia de disco elysium, no es una experiencia \u00e9pica, es una dram\u00e1tica, feliz, triste, graciosa, al final depende de ti, tu eres el que lleva la historia a tu manera, el juego deja que lo hagas, te incita a hacerlo, no te compensa subirte una cosa al m\u00e1ximo solo porque si o porque es mejor, nada es mejor ni peor no va de mejorar si no de Rolear, a dejarte llevar, a vivir una historia a tu manera, porque bueno no estas creando tu historia o tomando decisiones que hacen que el juego tome 3 caminos distintos porque elegiste chorizo en vez de salchich\u00f3n. El juego termina de la misma forma pero es el camino, los di\u00e1logos y las interacciones tan detalladas impulsadas por tu curiosidad y aptitudes basadas en tus gustos lo que te da la sensaci\u00f3n de estar viviendo esta historia a tu manera, de que estas roleando, por eso el juego no te pone trabas o dificultades, pero tampoco te regala nada hay cosas dif\u00edciles de resolver o cosas que no podr\u00e1s hacer, pero todo se basa mas en tu ingenio curiosidad suerte y dedicaci\u00f3n que en tu habilidad para jugar por lo que cualquiera puede superarse y sentir satisfacci\u00f3n pero sin regalar todo el juego. No me sorprenden que llamen a este juego el mejor RPG, porque es de los pocos que se acord\u00f3 de que se puede rolear, de que tu progresi\u00f3n no solo puede ser que empezaste con espada d\u00e9bil y terminaste con espada fuerte, si no que tu progresi\u00f3n puede ser tambi\u00e9n psicol\u00f3gica, tu punto de vista del mundo puede cambiar, te puedes arrepentir de no haber hecho una cosa, de haberte aliado con alguien, tus arrepentimientos vienen de tus interacciones con el mundo y la historia y no de que duraste media hora buscando una lanza in\u00fatil que no hace nada. Se acord\u00f3 de que el mundo se puede mover sin ti, de que no necesitas ser el centro de todo, si no que el mundo puede brillar sin el protagonista, el mundo puede estar con o sin el detective borracho, y eso se refleja en el final de el juego que es el mas adecuado, El mundo no esta para celebrarte si no para que formes parte de el la historia no esta para contarte un cuento o que lo escribas si no que para que participes en el a tu manera, puedes ser el polic\u00eda borracho comunista que odia a los ricos, el polic\u00eda inteligente y responsable ultraliberal, el loco que escucha que su corbata le habla y le hace caso, Puedes ser lo que quieras y a tu modo vas a experimentar este juego como solo tu puedes hacerlo. Vas a recorrer el mundo a tu manera, si fallas una tirada no te interesa que no haya sido perfecta porque eso forma parte de la historia que estas viviendo.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistoria: de las mejores que he visto, inesperada con varios giros de trama que nunca me espere, todos los personajes tienen su personalidad detalles, la historia terminara igual pero se sentir\u00e1 diferente tu marcas la diferencia no sientes que te fuiste sin hacer nada o que al final tus decisiones y acciones no importaban, unas importan, otras no, unas desviaciones no pudieron llevarte a nada pero si te divertiste haci\u00e9ndolas, todo los detalles y mec\u00e1nicas complementan la historia y la hacen mas cre\u00edble. Tambi\u00e9n toca temas pol\u00edticos, sociales, te los explica, te hace ver el mundo, no termina siendo un mensaje pretencioso y edgy si no que son realistas, contados de forma seria o con sarcasmo, y tu te los puedes tomar a tu manera porque el juego te deja hacerlo. Todo lo detallado que est\u00e1n los di\u00e1logos solo enriquecen la trama y hacen que todo sea mas grande. No es una historia incre\u00edble de un h\u00e9roe que cambia al mundo, es la historia de un modesto detective borracho, el cual tu decidir\u00e1s como va a ser, el final no cambia cambia el como llegamos a el como lo vemos como vivimos todo, cambio de forma sustancial haciendo que sintamos que realmente estamos haciendo algo distinto, no viene el t\u00edpico sentimiento de que no importa lo que hagamos nada cambiara, cambiaremos algunas cosas pero al final todo debe terminar de la manera adecuada para una historia cruda como esta.",

          "content": "After Four long years of development, tons of bad news and polemics surrounding it, and mixed reviews here and there, does Rime stand our expectations? Well... that is a good answer.\r\n\r\nRime has two mistakes, that in retrospective it's only one: it tried to be Fumito Ueda, without being Fumito Ueda. It is a game that wants you to feel emotions and stuff, but the puzzles you'll do are not original in any way, and even easy. And that's the main error of the game, it's a puzzle game with easy puzzle. Sacrilege!\r\nBut is that really it? Not to me. My opinion is different. RIME is about controlling a mysterious character, and exploring a beautiful island, trying to uncover what happened there and its secrets. And to advance, there are puzzles. It may sound the same, but it is way more enjoyable playing it with that mindset.\r\n\r\nBecause even if it's linear (another complain I don't get), the exploration pays off. There are many collectibles that go from random stuff, to clothes for our character, to pieces of the story, to related to the throphy hunting... there are many stuff to find, found in alternative small routes, hidden rooms, hidden in plain sight, optional areas... IT FEELS like you're exploring and doing something good. Diving into the beautiful scenery and the amazing OST, instead of the ok-average puzzles and obvious moments made to shock value only.\r\n\r\nOveral, RIME is a very good game that I think many people is focusing it incorrectly. But I understand it: the good point of the game comes if you spend your time and explore, other than beating the game asap. Or, if you're not convinced, wait a bit for regular or Steam sales.\r\nAlso, play it until the end to judge it, like all games.",

The game's atmosphere, the side characters and supporting characters are so brilliantly flushed out. I read every piece of parchment I could find and was genuinely intrigued by everyone's backstory. I did every side mission I could find. Brilliant game! Now for the furtherment of the story, in the sequel, I propose that the devs not repeat the same formula again with a new Ekon. Rather continue with Jonathan and base the second game around Jonathan perfecting the cure for Elizabeth. Also, expand upon the story of the Red Queen and Myrrin. To eternally vanquish the red queen or Myrrin, it is up to the devs to include that segment in the sequel or maybe extend it to a trilogy. ",

          "content": "Vampyr is a head-scratcher for me. It is a modern semi-open world game with non-schematic world building, which is an attractive proposition for someone who plays typical old-fashion Ubisoft-style open world games. However, the way it sounds and how the developers intended the game to be did not necessarily translate to the final product. The game starts with ambiguous tutorials and explanations on how your choices affect the story and characters, and trust me, your choices affect everything around you. You are not given any pointer as to what will change, and your assumptions while playing might not be accurate. This will (or will not) pay off later in the story, when you probably finally grasp the consequences of your actions, which might totally contradict your intentions in the first place. Vampyr is a great game to play twice, though. Once you play through it, you then know what you are trying to achieve and how to achieve it, and the second play-through will be definitely more enjoyable. While the combat is quite good (not easy, but fully customizable), the story is great, and the characters are excellent, the structure of the game and its confusing mechanics leave a bitter taste and make you wonder what might have been \"if\". Still, if there ever is Vampyr 2, I will happily give it a shot.",

Tout est fluide.\r\n\r\nToutefois, le jeu semble beaucoup trop long et \u00e9tir\u00e9 que ce qu'il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre. J'ai l'impression d'avoir une oeuvre de plusieurs dizaines d'heures juste pour atteindre une dur\u00e9e de vie longue. La redondance est pesante et au bout d'un moment, le manque de nouveaut\u00e9 se fait ressentir. Bien que je prenais le temps d'\u00e9couter tous les dialogues et que je m'int\u00e9ressais aux collectibles et qu\u00eates secondaires, j'ai fini par passer toutes les sc\u00e8nes, chose que je ne fais presque jamais dans un jeu.\r\n\r\nLa m\u00e9canique principale du jeu \u00e0 devoir choisir son c\u00f4t\u00e9 humain ou son c\u00f4t\u00e9 vampire est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressante, mais pas assez exploit\u00e9e. Au vu de la redondance du jeu et du c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9tir\u00e9, choisir le c\u00f4t\u00e9 vampire n'am\u00e8ne pas vraiment de malus, j'ai vite ressenti que \u00e7a ne changeait rien au jeu \u00e0 part \u00eatre plus puissant et pouvoir le terminer plus rapidement.\r\n\r\nEn terme de level-design, on se perd souvent. C'est difficile de trouver le bon chemin et on tourne souvent en rond. Les voyages (tout \u00e0 pied) entre les diff\u00e9rentes parties de la ville deviennent tr\u00e8s lourds.\r\n\r\nPour l'histoire (le point qui m'int\u00e9resse en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral le plus dans les jeux), c'est chouette sans \u00eatre exceptionnel. Le d\u00e9roulement se fait bien, le protagoniste \u00e9volue psychologiquement et ce qui est autour aussi. Cependant, l'histoire se d\u00e9roule pas devant nous. J'ai l'impression de la lire et de l'entendre par les conversations, mais il n'y a pas vraiment de cin\u00e9matiques d'action. Je ferais aussi le m\u00eame reproche que j'ai pour Life is Strange o\u00f9 je trouve que les personnages manquent de personnalit\u00e9. Tous acceptent les requ\u00eates sans broncher ou avouent leurs erreurs. Les rapports entre les personnages sont trop simples et rapides.\r\n\r\nGraphiquement c'est sympa pour un jeu ind\u00e9pendant. On remarque le c\u00f4t\u00e9 irr\u00e9aliste des animations (si on compare avec notre habitude du mocap des triple-a) cependant.",

          "content": "This game in many ways feels like a spiritual sequel to Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines and since that games sequel isn't coming for another million years, this is the next best thing. To start with the good, I enjoyed the story a lot, as Dontnod have always been great storytellers to me. It had a lot of twists and turns, and the characters were all very well done. Its helped also by some very good voice acting that really helps sell the dialogue. I also love the amount of choice and consequence you get in this game, that a lot of RPGs nowadays tend to lack. They also do a lot of interesting things with the vampire lore and I found it all very interesting to read through and discover.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade system for the weapons is also pretty cool. I'm not super picky when it comes to presentation and overall I enjoyed it. The vampire powers you get also are very cool with some I used constantly. My favorite being the power where you can boil an enemies blood and make them explode which is ripped straight out of Bloodlines which I appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe combat is okay overall. It can feel very clunky in the beginning but does get better as you upgrade your weapons and level up. Only thing I didn't like was the lock on mechanic which can get really annoying to deal with as it will sometimes switch targets while your still fighting the enemy you originally locked onto which I hated.\r\n\r\nSome of the things I didn't like was the lack of fast travel. The open world map isn't too big (which I liked), but it can get really frustrating when you have to back track to previous districts and have to fight the same annoying enemies over and over. I'm also not a fan of the autosave system, as everything you do is tied to one save slot. I get that the devs wanted you to have to live with your decisions throughout the story which makes sense for a narrative focused game like Life is Strange, but I would have preferred a manual save system as that's typically how I like my RPGs. I'm not as big of a fan of the hint system where you need to find out more about a character through either questioning them, finding out from other characters or finding notes around the world. Its fine with side characters, but it can be very frustrating with some of the major NPCs for each district where you need to make a crucial choice with them and the best option, is locked behind you having all the hints for them unlocked. I just didn't like this system at all, and it lead to me having to make crappy choices. And finally I just wished there was more to the games ending. I got what I believe is the good ending, and it was satisfying, but you don't get any ending slides for any of the main NPCs or districts which was disappointing. Especially since some characters fates were kind of left hanging in my playthrough.",

Beating the Heart on A20 is very challenging, and very rewarding, even on rebeats. There are endless possibilities scattered across four incredibly fun and unique characters.

          "content": "To start with what I like, I love the different classes and builds you can make in this game. Each character has their own specific decks and unlockables you can get throughout the game and they can all have multiple different builds, depending on what cards and relics you get in a given run. My favorites are a poison focused Silent and a elemental core focused Defect who really are fun and devastating to play with. I also love that you can upgrade the cards you get and make them deadlier, It just makes the combat so much more fun and enjoyable for me as a long time fan of Hearthstone and Yu Gi Oh.\r\n\r\nAnd there's just so much to see and do. You have to beat the game with all the different characters, and then beat the secret act 4 with each of them. And then you still have the ascension levels to tackle, which add modifiers to your runs to make them harder. The amount of content and replayabilltiy here is staggering and its very commendable.\r\n\r\nAnd then the best part of the game is the mods. On the steam version of this game (which is the version I recommend), this game has full workshop support which makes this title even better. You can download things from new characters, new cards, quality of life enhancements and even full on fan expansions, like Downfall. It just adds so much more value to an already great package.\r\n\r\nNow onto the bad. While I said the mods are great for this game, it also works against it a bit, as I found this game to just be way too punishing. I legit wasn't able to finish this game until I downloaded a mod called easy mode (but still not really easy) that makes that you heal your health fully after each combat encounter. You can say its a skill issue on my part, but I just found this mod alone enhanced the experience so much more for me personally. The game isn't brain dead easy by this change as I still die constantly, but what it does do is make the game way more balanced and fair. In the base game, you can get relics and cards to help you heal but its often not by much. The main way to heal is by coming to campfires you find, where you can either upgrade your cards or heal, but you can only do one per campfire. I do not like this choice as 1, resting only heals your health partially anyway and 2, it deprives you of being able to upgrade your cards as you will almost always be low on health. And upgrading your cards I feel is essential to completing runs and making any progress in this game. When I had the mod installed I could focus more on upgrading my cards and because of that I was able to make way more progression, but not too much progress as I once again still die a lot in this game and I have only been able to beat act 4 once. Maybe if they made it so that if you do rest, you fully heal your health which it would make the choice more enticing, but otherwise this has basically become a game I would only ever play with mods, and would never play it on console where that's not an option.\r\n\r\nOtherwise most of my original complaints still stand. The animations are very limited and your character doesn't even change their pose when attacking. The game is also really unpredictable and a lot of times as there are certain bosses and elite enemies (mini-bosses) that if you don't have a super powerful deck and the right relics, you will almost always lose as the devs just made them way too powerful.\r\n\r\nMy last major complaint is the ascension levels and the unlocks. As you play you earn XP and unlock 5 levels worth of unlocks for each character. The ascension levels go up to 20 and like I said they add modifiers. They also give you more XP compared to playing normally, but there's a huge flaw with this. For me, by the time I beat the game with a character and unlocked their ascension levels, I had already gotten most of the their unlocks. The ascension levels let me get the last few unlocks but after that there really is just no reason to do ascension, since theirs nothing more to unlock. All your doing at that point is making the game harder with no reward, which I get some will like but I don't. They should have made exclusive unlocks that you can only get by hitting certain ascension level milestones. That would make it more worth it in my opinion.",

          "content": "A colorful metroidvania with charming pixel art, challenging puzzles, and a surprisingly dark story, Iconoclasts follows the journey of a rebellious mechanic named Robin as she traverses the world, escaping the clutches of the One Concern and helping everyone along the way. The game has many different locations to explore, each with its own intricate puzzles and secrets. The player uses a large wrench and a blaster with various modes to solve unique puzzles and defeat powerful bosses. The puzzles have a lot of thought put behind them, making the player use specific game mechanics to get through them. The boss fights are unique and challenging, often requiring players to figure out the gimmick behind one and how to use it to their advantage. As Robin continues her journey, she meets new people who become her friends and allies as they assist and travel with her. The story wasn't nearly as lighthearted as I thought it would be, but I consider it to be the game's best part. The characters had in-depth personalities, backgrounds, and personal problems to deal with as they grew as people. The game also has collectibles and a few sidequests to give the player more gameplay beyond the main story. There's even a challenge mode for hardcore players who want a more formidable experience. Overall, Iconoclasts isn't one of the best games I have ever played, but I still consider it a unique experience that metroidvania and indie game fans would enjoy.",

The control mechanics are very well designed, challenging, yet sometimes forgiving, allowing you to smash some buttons and still get the result you want. The art style is awesome too, all levels are beautiful.\n\nI've really enjoyed the twist at the middle of the game, it almost look like a completely different game, when I though the game was ending, they just thrown in the double amount of gameplay on us. For me personally the game was longer than it needed to be, maybe because I wanted to get all the green coins, if I have ignored this maybe the game would have a good amount of gameplay length.\n\nThe story is cool too, very original and well told, and the comedy in this game is one of its many strenghts.",

          "content": "Playing the game, it will definitely feel familiar to those who have played System shock, with the enemy types, the feeling of isolation in space, and the ships you move through. They definitely nailed the atmosphere and the feeling you could die at any moment. Each time you die, you play as a new character with their own traits. It is possible to swap traits out at specific machines or find these gene altering anomalies in space, which change your traits when you fly your ship near them. The gameplay loop involves you going from ship to ship, looting items, trying to find the main item you need and then hightailing it back to your ship. You also need to keep track of resources like fuel for your ship and food for your character. Each ship is procedurally generate with its own specific traits, that can work both against and for you. E.g. security bots being on your side, hazards like electrical wires, fire and radiation leaks.\r\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed the gameplay loop of this game and the weapons are all fun to use. You do at the very least keep your weapons and upgrades when you die and just lose your ammo and supplies (but you start out with a small amount at the start of each run). I love the comic book art style and the soundtrack is also pretty awesome! The game can also be very funny at times, with some very dry British humor.\r\n\r\nSome of the things I didn't like was the RNG aspects of it. You can have some runs where you get lucky and your having a great time playing, and other times where the dice doesn't roll in your favor and you just get frustrated. I don't mind RNG in games like Borderlands because its just specifically tied to the weapons you find, and not the levels themselves. I much prefer handcrafted levels that all feel unique from one another. After a while the ships all start to look the same and the gameplay starts to feel repetitive but the game ended for me right about when that started to set in, so it balanced itself out. I also just wish this game had a proper story campaign to hook me, as the games story is pretty basic and is just there to give the player urgency. Even if they perhaps included audio logs or lore entries for you to find, that explained why the universe is the way is, would have helped.",

Let's start with the fact that the game is incredibly long, too many monotonous empty locations. Why? The very first urban location was very cool, nice unusual visual/music, interesting game design, where you could enter/examine each apartment, and find windows from which you can look at the area that is still inaccessible to you, and sticking the barrel out of the window, shoot helpless mobs in advance + these twisted street reliefs themselves looked very unique. What's NEXT? The next 4-7 locations look just gray corridors. Either it\u2019s some kind of sewerage, or it\u2019s some kind of desert, or it\u2019s just a really empty \u201cnon-decorative\u201d corridor, as if we\u2019re running straight through the locka from Quake 1) After the first level, all interesting game design disappears, everything becomes as primitive and simple as possible \"old-school shooter\". Then there will be the first boss in the ruined Walmart, which breathes life into you a little, but also just running from him in a circle. Next, a new section of 5 locations awaits you, which are also absolutely not memorable, well.. it was cool walking along the walls in a psychiatric hospital, but.. I was expecting some kind of battle in vertical space when the room was turned upside down, but no, the developers are afraid to do it, just come, press the button, everything here is as simple as possible. But the final boss in section 2 is very cool, this shotgun \"stealed\" from Doom with a hook is used here as it should, it's a pity that it's very short level, but it's just a gameplay-fun boss. And, so.. From the 3rd section, it starts to play much more cheerfully, because different interesting settings, supermarket, then some kind of james bond in the office, then a bond in space, and all this still \"carries\" a good soundtrack \"on its shoulders\", they took a good composer , and, he tried, I'm not talking about the music of the battles, they are very generic, I'm talking about ambient - the atmosphere of the location. So, WHY?, Hyperstrange, why couldn't you make 2 sections of 5 levels, but \"invest\" more in them? Well, the game very bored in the middle, you don\u2019t have enough ideas for such a long duration, they could have made it shorter, the game would have been more dynamic, and more fun, the \u201cmiddle locations\u201d should have been cut out in general. There in 1 office location in 3 section - 3 funny moments! , while in most locations, the spirit of \"Postal\" is not felt at all, replace the name of the game with any other shooter, nothing will change. That's about the same here with weapons, after level 1 you will stop using a homing pistol at all, a bunch of extras, abilities you will accumulate in your inventory unnecessarily.. What can i say about guns? Well, normal) Again, there seems to be nothing to hate about.. But they came up with a creative vacuum cleaner with cats, a real weapon in the spirit of \"Postal\", the only thing, probably, it is cool also in terms of gameplay, but you get it closer to the end, although, of course, the animation of the cats is crooked.. In short, I have the same claim here, it was necessary to make weapons in smaller quantities, but more unique. And.. I can\u2019t say anything about enemies either, there are a dime a dozen of them here, some are good, some are stupid, in the general mass.. for playing for beer fits, okay) Well.. I can note a car driving at you from 100 km/h, that`s really cool enemy)\n\nThe gameplay itself here, despite the newfangled hooks (by the way, it's funny that the recent Shadow Warior 3 also used this trend), is not dynamic, the most convenient thing here is \"shot, went behind the wall, shot, went away\", very old, well, for someone then ok maybe. You can only do a high jump after a roll, which is very inconvenient, who came up with this anyway?) Lo\u0441ks are divided into conditional \"rooms\" that open with keys, after clearing all the sections on your way, you will find everything without any problems, there are no puzzles here, you can only blunt it 2 times in the whole game. Cool they came up with a new way of \"opening something\", you need to \"pee\" to hit the conditional \"button\", this is funny, yes,\nIn general, most of the humor here is connected with \"penises, penises, and once again PENISES..\", and farting, so I don't recommend eating while playing) Although there are also slightly satirical smarter moments, for example, PBD can be called the first game with jokes about COVID-19, but this is not enough, mostly shoot, shoot, and pinus pinus ahaha very funny ohoho (no), why, by the way, they didn\u2019t joke with the petitions?\n\nIn general, it turned out to be a good average shooter \"for YouTube\", with a generally creative concept that will give you a couple of pleasant little things for passing, but, with painfully viscous gameplay, not for \"old-school shooters-mastrbtors\", oh .. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist :) I can also note a couple of little things for developers, that for some reason there are no tips on how to fight enemies in the codex with descriptions of opponents, and you can't make several saves, what kind of nonsense is this? I almost ruined everything, I accidentally loaded into my quick save on the previous. level, and the only autosave was also immediately rewritten) I had to start the final level through the menu without all my accumulated bonuses, but the bosses here are quite easy.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\n/\n\u041d\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e,

Fairly short considering the type of game this is, the game honestly serves as an intro to Hundred Heroes, and it shows: The gameplay is decent, but the grinding doesn't feel particularly gratifying, with a very short repeat cycle. Furthermore, the game is more a 'mini quest rush' than a proper adventure, and after a while they get really boring, decreasing the enjoyment of the adventure significantly. Still, the bosses were fun, and the first half is pretty solid gameplay-wise.\n\nOnto characters, they're pretty solid, and the story, despite feeling very rushed, especially towards the end, it's cute. Predictable, but cute. All in all, the main characters are solid, although I wish they didn't leave all the reveals to the final 2 hours of the game. The story of the town is pretty interesting, especially because it feels very low risks in the sense that you are effectively caring more about the town and it shows; bits like the hot springs signal this strongly. A shame that the mini quests that you do to make the town feel livelier at the same time bring down the atmosphere quite a while.\n\nI dunno if I would recommend the game to other people, but it was a solid fun adventure nonetheless. Just, not something I feel has any replay value, really.",

When hearing of the game, I expected a five hour experience in the same vein as bloodstained, However the game clocked in at 15 hours, 80% of which felt like side quests  getting a single piece of treasure that was blocked on a map. \n\nRealistically, there is one issue that stands out and that is the simple fact you can't dash in Town. This may sound silly but as I said, a majority of the time, you're just manueviring around 15 maps in the town and in town, that means you are spending the majority of it moving half, maybe more, of the speed you can zip through dungeons. If this was a shorter game, you could forgive issues such as simple gampeplay and low difficulty but when it hits this length, small problems can become genuine annoyances. Unfortunately, because of this, the game becomes hard to recommend, other than knowing at least one character will be avaliable in the upcoming RPG",

The twist is that she has a psychotic mental disorder (likely schizophrenia) and a history of trauma. The game puts you in her shoes, meaning you experience visual and auditory (voices) hallucinations, and are never sure what is a delusion and what is real.\nThe game is very sensitive toward mental illness, they got several psychiatrists on board and consulted with mentally ill people to make sure its accurate and reflects the experiences of real people.\nEven the puzzles in the game where you look for patterns in your surroundings represent how a delusional person searches and finds patterns and connections that others see as coincidence. \n\nThe game looks amazing, the art style and visual effects work brilliantly. The sound design is great as well.\nThe combat is fairly simple but fun and challenging. There wasn't a huge variety of enemies. However the combat isn't a main focus of the game and there are long stretches without combat, so this wasn't a problem at all. The variety of settings and game mechanics kept the game feeling fresh the whole way through. \n\nIt's a very well paced ans cinematic story, it's gritty and deals with difficult/important subjects really well.

          "content": "A game made by an independent studio that truly lives to the \"AAA standards\". It may be the best-looking indie game yet, and also one of the deepest, most beautiful game experiences in years.\n\nHellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a game that blends hack &amp; slash combat with puzzle solving and exploration. The main story, partly based on Celtic mythology, focuses on Senua, a female warrior who must travel to Hel (the Nordic land of  the dead) to save the soul of her dead lover. On her path she must fight monsters and \"the darkness\", the latter which she believes to be a curse that is consuming her body and mind. Of course, this is but an analogy for the character's struggle with psychosys, a mental disorder which causes hallucinations and delusions. In this regard, Senua is one of the deepest, most tormented characters in recent videogame history. Once you understand the context, the visions and supernatural events become absolutely devastating. \n\nAn essential part of the game's atmosphere is the sound design, so well made and eerie it will make you doubt your own sanity. Senua will hear several voices speaking at the same time, at almost every moment, that will warn or advise (sometimes wrongly) about the player's decisions. Also, most of the game puzzles are based on visual perspective and mind-games, very fitting for Senua's \"curse\". During some stages, the player will have to walk around for several minutes and explore every possible angle before finding the right answer. While most of these riddles are very clever, there is a point in which they become repetitive or too simple. Same goes for combat, which is only exciting when facing multiple enemies, and even so it goes dull after about one hour. This occurs because the enemies look and act the same, so the player can approach all of them in a similar fashion. The fact they are extremely slow makes it the less challenging. Even the bosses are very easy to beat. Franky, the most enjoyable parts of the game are those which do not involve combat, especially since some fighting sections last for just too long. \n\nFrom a narrative and technical perspective, it's a gorgeous, profound and heart-breaking experience. One that moved me deeply, and I will not forget any time soon. As an action game it's lacking some polish, but it's easy to forgive it due to its outstanding artistic ambition.",

The voices and solving puzzles by searching for patterns where there were none was a great representation of mental illness.\nThe combat was a little bit off, but game threw at you variations of enemies, mixing them and increasing difficulty, which saves situation.\nThe lore is great, I loved mini lessons about Viking's mythos.

          "content": "The game firstly is best played with headphones as you can hear the voices in Senua's head which really allows you to take in the world and atmosphere! The voices will both help and taunt you at the same time which helps build the tension and anxiety. The game is extremely tense from the combat, to the dark atmosphere and hopelessness of the story. While the game is not super difficult, you do need to focus on what you're doing in combat encounters, as one wrong move can lead to your death, which spreads the infection on Senua's arm, which if it reaches her head, its permadeath with your saves files being deleted. This mechanic isn't as bad as it sounds as I got through the game without it ever happening, but what it does do is keep you on your toes. My playthrough was frustrating but in a good way, as each death felt like a true failure on my part and the enemies certainly aren't pushovers either as you have to pay attention in fights and time your block, parries and attacks at the right time, otherwise you will die a lot.\r\n\r\nThe story overall is emotional as I loved going on Senua's journey. The story expertly brings to light issues of mental health in our society and how it is important to help the people in need who have these issues in their lives. Because of that this is a double AA game with a lot of heart put into it, in a world where publishers dictate games development and take away creative freedom from developers in the name of profit and monetization.",

          "content": "Kona is a piece of interactive storytelling that blends mystery with folk horror, allowing the player to uncover the mystery almost literally on their own. \n\nThe main character, Carl Faubert, is a private investigator sent to North of Qu\u00e9bec to watch on a powerful man, accused by a native community of defiling their land. The game unfolds in a semi-open world composed only by a few roads. The player is free to choose Carl's path in any order to solve the mystery that surrounds the town. While this encourages exploration, the lack of clear objectives also might render the game a bit frustrating. Carl has got a limited inventory space, and since there is no linear progress, it's possible that you will drop an object needed to complete a future part of the game, meaning you will have to go back. Fortunately you can store some objects in the back of your truck, so I advise any newcomer to do this and avoid wasting time. \n\nThe game has some scarce and extremely simple combat: you will only face wolves that die by two hits of an axe. The AI is atrocious and the weapon wielding controls are awkward. Fortunately it isn't much of a problem because the game does not focus on action sequences. Instead, there will be lots of walking around, picking objects and solving some puzzles. There is a survival element, as well: the player must take care of Carl's health, stress (similar to the \"sanity\" mechanic in Amnesia) and cold levels. For the first half, surviving in the environment is the most interesting part of the game, although it may become unfair not being able to carry enough objects. So keep that in mind: always carry at least one log to make a fire. \n\nFor a game made with the Unity engine, it's not graphically too bad, but it suffers from the expected stiffness and outdated texture rendering. There are also some minor development issues, like doors opening to only one side, so that when you press the action button it will get stuck because Carl's blocking it. The audiviosual design is mostly enough to create a dark and ethereal atmosphere, but you really will need to be invested in the story and the world's lore, which can be found through scattered notes and other documents. This is a slow-burning game that requires lots of patience and the right mood.",

          "content": "Kona is an incredibly comfortable mystery survival game set in an isolated town during the 70s. It makes you balance being a detective and investigating the lives of an entire town with surviving in the harsh elements of the Canadian wilderness.\n\nKona combines this all brilliantly by making sure the survival aspect isn't front and center never getting in the way of the real meat of the game which is snooping into everyone's lives and reading all of their business. The survival aspect is akin more to flavoring because if you're diligent it shouldn't affect you too much.\n\nThe game saves when you activate or are near fireplaces so it can create these nice mundane moments. I've found myself in a new house without a log to make a fire a few times, but I just had to wander out back into the cold to get a log from the pack of my pickup truck. Same with the sanity mechanic. It basically amounts to needing to smoke or drink something but after a tense moment lighting up a cig can be really cathartic.\n\nSnooping around the various houses of this town is great. The detail in the various rooms and cupboards make the routine of driving from house to house pretty entertaining. Each house reflects the person who lives in it perfectly and while there are some real standout weirdos a lot of them just lend to this feeling of loneliness. You're in this big warm house, drawings litter the floor and food is packed in the fridge. Where is everyone?\n\nThe overarching mystery is interesting but I don't want to mention too much of that. It's very much worth untangling this thread on your lonesome.\n\nFrom the snowed in setting to the amazing attention to detail it's safe to say I loved Kona so I'd really like you to experience this game for yourself. There's a lot I didn't mention that I'm sure you'll get a kick out of, I know I sure did. I recommend getting it on sale if you think 6ish hours is too short but I could see this immersive gem justifying that base price with it's experience alone.",

          "content": "1970, Northern Quebec\u2014A private investigator, Carl Faubert, is traveling to a small town to solve a simple crime.  Events conspire against him however and he is thrust into a strange and deadly investigation of an abandoned town in the middle of a snowstorm with more than just one mystery to solve.  What happened here, what is going on, and, more importantly, where is everybody?\n\nKONA is a moderate survival exploration game that has you investigating various buildings, finding clues, and traveling through a frozen world in search of more clues and locations.  The world can be dangerous\u2026you may freeze to death if you don\u2019t light a fire from time to time or you can be eaten by wolves if you aren\u2019t careful\u2014but you are given tools in order to help you through your during your stay.  You also have access to your truck which helps with travelling around the map\u2026at least where there are roads.\n\nThe town of Atamipek and the surrounding area is small but beautiful\u2026and you will explore it during the middle of a snowstorm.  The howling winds and the snow crunching under your feet is enhanced with an interesting soundtrack and good narration allowing KONA to easily transport you to this snowy landscape full of intrigue and mystery.\n\nThe only issue that I had with KONA was with the load time between different areas.  Moving from one area to the next involved several seconds where the game would freeze while it loaded the next area\u2014breaking the immersion of the game.\n\nThe story was very well written and I enjoyed poking around the town to learn more about it and the missing inhabitants.  I was easily engaged with the story of KONA and did not get tired of looking for clues and reading the journal for more parts of the story.  As a note, there is one item in the game that could be considered recommended reading as it helps you understand the ending a bit more.\n\nGetting all the achievements took me two playthroughs and a bit of time\u2026but they are relatively easy to achieve and give a sense of accomplishment when attaining them.  Some of the achievements are based on the story while a good portion of them require a bit of effort to get and involve collecting items or avoiding some things altogether.  Altogether, a great game for Achievement Hunters.\n\nI enjoyed KONA and had a fun time exploring to town of Atamipek and solving the mystery.  While there were some issues that I had with the game; the story, sound, and the visuals are very well done and helped make this game interesting and fun to play.\n\nAs a note; KONA means \u201csnow\u201d in the Maskwac\u00ees Cree language.",

Garden Story is a bursting with personality and warmth, and the delightfully detailed pixel art, adorable character sprites, and mellow tunes that propel you along your journey make for a refreshing way to unwind from the constant stress of our chaotic modern world. \n\nGarden Story is a game that thrives on variety, and while its individual elements probably wouldn't be enough on their own to make for a very compelling game, it rarely asks you to work on anything for too long at a time, which saves it from repetition. You'll be helping out by fixing broken pipes or fighting monsters one minute, and gathering wood or minerals for the town library the next; how you choose to spend your day is entirely up to you, as well as the pace in which you set to do it. \n\nThe game does take its time in opening up to all of its possibilities, but I never really felt like I needed to grind things out in order to progress; as long as you're staying on top of your daily tasks, it doesn't take too long before Garden Story throws an entirely new element into the gameplay loop for you to explore.\n\nWhile there are a wealth of options and activities to complete, if there's any one area where Garden Story feels a bit lackluster, it's in the enemy variety; there are really only about three different basic enemies, with a couple variations of each, which is disappointing, given that about 40% of the game is spent in combat. In addition to this, I found that the game does seem to have glitches related to the building mechanics, where menus won't work properly, or the camera will stop following Conchord after interacting with an object you placed yourself. (This however, seems like something easily patched)\n\nThough I haven't really touched the post game just yet, I will say I've even enjoyed completing the side quests thus far since they don't feel too far out of the way, and some of the rewards I've received are just hilariously broken; I've been having a blast just bowling through areas to clear out monsters. All in all, I've had a really good time with this. \n8/10",

          "content": "First and foremost a warning to my fellow Christian videogame afficionados: this is a game about satanism. It heavily borrows from satanistic aesthetics and values, the protagonist is an open mockery of Christ, and the overarching message of this game is more or less satanist: \"We're already in hell, so walk on corpses looking for power, glory and riches, it is it's own and only reward\". So, if you're a Christian, don't play it and definitely don't buy it. For me personally this game is also a 'final warning' to abstain from Massive Monster &amp; Devolver production both.\n\nTo be fair, I'll name the sides of this game I'd call strong: the graphics are well drawn and rendered and the sound design is nice even if the overall quantity of sounds in this game is not very large.\n\nBeside my woes with this game's theme &amp; message, i actually do find plenty of problems with it otherwise. To name a few:\n\n* The metagame is mostly absent, which is kind of a disappointment for any roguelite. Any decision you make in this game are made as they are, they have no consequences except for the ones explicitly stated.\n\n* The base management, which is a prerequisite for protagonist development, is very monotonous, especially if you're trying to avoid sacrificing any of your cultists, which also makes little sense, since making either decision does not impact further gameplay \u2013 except for having to repeatedly re-run dungeons to recruit new followers.\n\n* Base decorations are mostly useless, their variance could easily be reduced by an order of magnitude without any gameplay impact whatsoever.\n\n* The animations are very poor and little in number.\n\n* The combat is very casual and have very low variance. Difficulty is adjusted mostly through enemy hitpoints, although sometimes also with small arena sizes \u2013 though this last one was perhaps unintentional.",

Together they create a pleasant enough mixture, but the individual pieces simply do not engage me enough to heartily recommend the act of playing the game with the same fervor I would recommend the game's exceptional sense of personality and art design. Cult of the Lamb has gotten some pushback recently as a cutesy game that delves into a caricature of darker, more horrifying themes. If this sort of thing upsets you, I strongly consider removing yourself from the act of looking for experiences that will offer artistic experiences, and instead look towards games for their equally valuable trait: entertainment. eSports, competitive multiplayer, and deck-building games are often exceptional for this, and I feel will be a much more enriching experience for anyone looking for a pleasant night out, because being unwilling to separate your personal puritanism from a work of fiction makes me unable to think anything else will offer you any sense of joy, and isn't that what's games are for, in theory at least? Joy?",

The developers gathered all their best ideas and polished them to give the players an excellent project. They also did not forget about the addictive plot and skillfully created atmosphere, the factors that captured me in the Ghosts of Maple Creek. At the same time I encourage you to familiarize yourself with the collector's edition of The Mists of Ravenwood, because the bonus chapter deserves the attention of the audience, being a neat combination of prequel and epilogue.\n",

          "content": "Coffee Talk is a nice, relaxing game. That is perhaps the best way to describe it. It's a great game to just wind down to.\n\nEverything about this game is meant to get you invested in the universe and its characters. That's what the game is ultimately about, the characters and the relationships they develop as you serve them coffee and observe. The music and the art style really seek to draw you into a warm environment where you can just focus on talking.\n\nThe characters are very deep and three-dimensional. The dialogue is well-written and you really start to get invested in what's happening.\n\nThe only complaint is that it's a bit short compared to similar games. That being said, its length doesn't really detract from anything that goes on. Every story arc feels complete, and every character is in the story for exactly how long they need to be. I just wish there was a bit more to it. More characters and more variety would have been nice.\n\nThe post-credits scene is also a bit weird and detracting in my opinion, but it isn't a huge deal. It didn't really feel like it was there for a purpose, but rather to just have a big \"woah, dude\" moment at the end.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10",

After passing the demo, it may seem that this is an exciting dynamic adventure in the spirit of Stanley Parable, but for some reason the devs filled the center of the game with \"rooms with a list of tasks\", I thought that there would always be something unexpected and new, that this is just a walker with elements, but in fact, in terms of genre, it`s - a puzzle, between story sections, you repeatedly find yourself in large rooms in which you need to solve several rebuses, talk with key characters, look for easter eggs, to break another mechanism and go further, and.. not to say it\u2019s bad, but it\u2019s too simple, too the same, it breaks the flow of the story, it\u2019s not interesting, you need to either move something, or change colors, or rearrange something, good that in every location there is a \"character-duck\", which can give detailed hints for any difficulty + there will be some miserable stealth, but there is very little of it, and after the 1st section, the devs themselves are already starting to joke about it.\nThat is, just don\u2019t expect anything from the game, and be prepared for the fact that this is a \u201cpuzzle\u201d, then you might get more excited, expecting something incredible - I got mixed emotions, but after the last level, I still stayed, in in general, with positive ones, since the last hour of the game finally returns to the \"correct\" path \"of the scripted hallway story walking simulator, and even has a touching ending, and a decent soundtrack.. The game was made by only a few people, I don't understand why they it was so stretched out, I completed it for about 7 hours!! Seven!! If they took an hour from the demo, an hour from the ending, and put the other 5 more dynamically, without these stupid rooms with tasks, it would have been less work, and the game would have been much more addictive, the humor here is also not particularly unique, and it certainly is not enough for 7 hours, devs could spend more time on a script and make some philosophical parallels with our reality, but instead this there are several endings in the game, a lot of voice actors, a lot of achievements, \"findable\" items to be able to replay the game 100 times :)\n\nOkay, I already scold quite a lot, this is still one of the most interesting projects of 2023, where else will you play as an update program inside a smartphone that is trying to survive? The visual is simple, but tasteful, there are humorous moments well borrowed from Stanley Parable, and a large number of achievements, content, \"replay value\" for only 13$ - for you, on the contrary, it can be a plus, and yes, there is a prolonged middle with mediocre gameplay, but by the end, the game has been \"corrected\", you won't regret it anyway.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators

          "content": "At first, I was in love with Dusk's fast-paced gameplay and heavy atmosphere. But as the game progresses I soon realized that for a game that takes heavy inspiration from titles of yesteryear it sure falls into a lot of pitfalls that are common among the genre's newest releases.\n\nReleasing January 10th, 2018 as an early access title the game launched with two episodes. The third and final episode wasn't released until December 10th, 2018, the day in which the game ceased to be in early access. The game garnered a lot of praise and I don't want to take that away. What I do think however is that not all of it is justified.\n\nMy first problem with the game is the inconsistency in quality. We don't know how long it took them to develop the third episode but the 11 months between the early access build and the finished product that contained said 3rd episode seems like a good guess. Either way, however, I feel like it could have used more time in the oven. The levels within commonly would just throw more enemies at you to increase tension rather than placing them in challenging locations and clusters. Multiple levels also reuse areas from prior. The game makes light of this and uses it to \"taunt the player\". This works as a nice moment of deja vu the first or second time but it got old fast. A great aspect of Dusk is how it continues to throw new things at the player. The third episode's main ace up its sleeve is the sword. Being able to slice and dice along with charging at enemies if your health is above 100 is a great layer to the weapon. Couple this with the power to block incoming attacks if your morale (armor) is above 50 and you have a quite versatile weapon that is great fun to use. That is if areas are designed around it. Sadly though besides the first level of episode 3, there are not many areas in which it becomes of good use especially because like I mentioned, this episode is fond of throwing hordes of enemies at you.\n\nSpeaking of, my next issue with the game is prevalent throughout the title. A common trend among throwback shooters, even the top tier ones like Doom Eternal is to have arena-like areas be a key component. Even at there best I still prefer the player guided combat progression you get in the games Dusk tries so hard to imitate. Arenas to me lack the versatility one has to deal with an encounter since your not able to use resources from other areas or to simply skip over a fight. In Dusk you're usually able to travel back to previous rooms but that doesn't mean nearly as much since often levels funnel you to one key area. This isn't always the case either. It's as if the developers made a game that has its arm around Doom's shoulders yet loves to French kiss Serious Sam when no one's looking. These two styles of level design are juxtaposed to one another and it really hurts the pacing in my opinion. These areas may be fun playgrounds but to me, it's simply not worth it due to the freedoms that are stripped away.\n\nThe graphics feel like they were ripped right out of Quake and to some that grew up with the title they may be hit with a wave of nostalgia. I, however, didn't grow up with games of brown and grey and in my eyes, Dusk can be a kind of ugly game. The thing is though that's not always the case. The keyword here is can be. At times this game simply astounded me with its visual presentation but there are more than a few levels that contain only 2 or 3 colors. I'm not asking for the game to be extremely bright but a wider color palette and the same attention to detail found in levels like The Iron Cathedral or The Infernal Machine would go a long way in making Dusk feel like the game it's trying so hard to be.\n\nA common trend found within Dusk is to use its great lighting and sound design to scare the player. This is great at first but after a while taking away your flashlight, again and again, got old. With this focus on horror the game also slows down during these moments and that's where the real problem lies. It makes sense on paper to have areas that are lacking in confrontation in order to break up the giant arenas but these areas are far too common for my liking and again its as if someone is continually taking away and giving back my meatball sub. Then after the game's done taunting you it finally lets you finish your now cold but still good sandwich in peace. In some ways, it seems as if it wants to mimic what Half-Life did, but the problem with this is Half-Life is a different kind of game. It's a story-driven exploratory FPS that has shooting in it but that's definitely not the main focus for a lot of the game. Dusk, as I hope you would know by now, is a shooter. A bloody, blisteringly fast-paced, surge of adrenaline-filled mayhem. So why the hell would I want to be crawling through vents when I could be painting these catacombs with redneck entrails?\n\nThe balancing of the game is good but could use some work. Even when flying through a wide-open area at high speeds it's still hard to avoid some enemy projectiles. I was playing the game on the second hardest difficulty and projectiles are faster because of that but that's simply not an excuse. Playing a game on the intended hard mode (since the hardest mode says that it's for masochists and you die in one hit) shouldn't compromise a key aspect of the combat. Well, that is if projectiles are made to be avoided more easily like in the lower difficulties. But what I said still stands though sense if the real projectile speed is the speed in which they move in the hard mode then all that means is that the easier difficulty modes are the ones that compromise the game's combat.\n\nAgain my point is not to say that this game isn't amazing. Looking at 5 seconds of gameplay will tell you that. The point of this is to do what not many are doing and that's to critique. If we become satisfied and don't seek to constantly evolve and grow our medium games will become stagnant. Oh, wait for the triple-A FPS genre already is. So umm... let's make sure the throwback shooter genre doesn't.",

For those of you uninitiated, you can expect labyrinthian levels, key hunting, and killing hordes of enemies whose corpses will litter your path. The action is fast-paced and the game has atmosphere in spades. You plow your way through cultist, Lovecraftian beasts in levels with plenty of non-euclidian geometry. \n\nIf all this sounds great, well, it is... the only real issue is the game is front-loaded with good levels. The first of the three episodes' levels are amazing, however, the second and third episode has more than their fair share of duds in the mix. The action is still there however you may find yourself walking in circles more than you would like. \n\nWhen push comes to shove Dusk is a banger that is well worth your time if you enjoy the \"Boomer Shooter\" genre or if you just like fast-paced, frenetic gameplay. Dusk comes so close to being a classic shooter that it hurts that it falls just the smallest bit short. ",

          "content": "DUSK can be best described as a modern boomer shooter. At its core it's similar to shooters of the 90\u2019s, but it isn't limited by the technologies of that time. Overall it's a very well made game with an amazing atmosphere, great soundtrack, satisfying combat and only a few minor flaws. You could also call it a horror game, since although you are pretty much a killing machine, DUSK can still scare you.\nStory\nYou are DUSK dude fighting off KKK look-alike cultists. DUSK keeps the almost no story tradition of 90\u2019s shooters.\nGameplay\nIt's an FPS, but unlike other games of the genre you have adequate mobility and can hold an entire arsenal of weapons. That's pretty much what a boomer shooter is. While DUSK doesn't add anything new to the formula but it does everything that is expected perfectly. Satisfying weapons, fun and unique enemies, good level design, there is only one minor critique I can make. That is that it has only one unique weapon and look-alikes of the others can be found in many other games.\nGraphics and artstyle\nWhile the graphics are low-poly and something more akin to the 90\u2019s it's by no means ugly. DUSK uses lighting and color to make the scenery and levels look surprisingly good. \nAtmosphere \nBest way I can describe it is a leisurely and very bloody stroll down to insanity that makes sure to take in all of the scenery along the way.\nSoundtrack\nGive it up for Andrew Hulshult. That guy consistently makes really metal ost and this one's for me among his best. Reflections of Violence is my favorite part of the ost.\nFinal Thoughts\nQuaff beer\nDevour cooked viscera\nSpin sicles\n",

          "content": "To start with the positives, the atmosphere of this game is just so on point. I like the rural, rustic look the game goes for, and as a big Resident Evil 4 fan, I love that you start out in farm land, and have to fight big guys with chainsaws and bags over their heads. The guns are all really awesome and they feel satisfying to use. Movement is fast and responsive, and the game does a good job of making you feel like death incarnate.\r\n\r\nThe real show stealer though I feel was the games level design. Some levels feel like the standard 90s goodness that you would want in a game like this, but others really do some crazy stuff. It goes above and beyond what you would have typically seen in a 90s FPS game, and I really appreciated it. Games like Prey and Dishonored made me appreciate level design a whole lot more then I did before and this game excels at that!\r\n\r\nThe music as well is excellent and I'm glad I bought the OST alongside the game. It can sound similar to the new Doom games, but it also does some out of the norm tracks that I loved.\r\n\r\nAs for negatives, while the first episode did a great job establishing the vibe and tone, the second one was just a slog to play through for me personally. It does have some good levels but it overall just dragged for me and I wanted it to be over by the halfway point. The game does pick it back up in episode 3, but ya I do wish the second episode was stronger. While I did praise the level design, some levels can be really annoying to traverse and like they took the mind-bending stuff a bit too far. Like there's one level where the gravity gets warped and you have to basically space jump across the map to get inside a house. That was not fun at all. Also the second last level was really bad and just felt like a giant horde mode section before the final boss. The final boss itself though was very strong and it ended the game with a bang!",

I appreciate the way it retains the more intricate aspects of soulslike combat despite the 2D format, resulting in something almost fighting game-esque at times.

There was one that literally shocked me to the point of dropping my controller and staring dumbfounded. All of this is wrapped up in a plot that might not be winning any awards, but still has enough intricacy and emotional weight to keep a player invested.

By the way, you can make a normal character, but, according to other characters and the game, its seems like it again LGBT.\n\nThe visual here is very weak, it seems like the picture should be cool, it\u2019s cartoony, but take a look, for example, at the \"Sable\" videogame, it has exactly the same graphics, but what awesome views in it and what kind of generic graphics are there, they didn\u2019t try at all on the visual part.\nAbout the same thing with music, it is very simple here, as if from some kind of fitness center)\nDon\u2019t expect any story here either, they just added a certain concept that there is a skateboarding planet and there is a skateboarding master, he / she is tired and wants to retire, now you should to become a master) Before the start of the levels you will always have dialogues with characters, they more for jokes, and even then they can only be funny or funny to children. The characters are also not memorable.\n\nOtherwise, the controls is good, the game is not difficult, the original Olli was harder for me. There are tricks, as in the original, perhaps there are fewer of them, well, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t pass the whole game. I can also note that the game is very fast and the eyes get tired of playing it for a long time.\n\nAnd, Olli Olli 2: Welcome to Olliwood is still the best part for me.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curator`s page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

          "content": "This was a good puzzle game, very much like \"Q.U.B.E.\" but with beautiful (and less oppressive) environments.\n\nThe puzzle aspects are almost all based on manipulation of gravity and magnetism. The physics (at least for me) worked well and were very intuitive (remember that magnetism can go through surfaces!), and only a few times I had to fudge around my solution to get it to work in ways which seemed unintended.... oh, probably my fault for trying strange solutions.\n\nBesides, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous to look at, and I found the story and dialogue well written (mind you, characters use the F-words frequently, so, if that bothers you, you might want to stay away; and the main character has \"plot blindness\" for a while, but that is oh-so-common in all media).\n\nSome flaws: the game severely limits your ability to go explore the environment, using many artificial walls; but that might be a good thing -- the \"space station\" environments, which do allow some exploration, are graphically pretty but very empty and lifeless (nearly non-interactable), which comes across as very boring. I would rather have limited but interesting exploration than lots of freedom to do boring stuff (looking at you, collectibles).\n\nBut all in all, an enjoyable puzzle game, not as creative as Portal or The Talos Principle (in part because there are very few different puzzle mechanics), but still a nice romp, with an interesting story. Score: 82/100.",

Aside from that, some of its minigame-type portions feel a bit awkward and under-developed - which I would normally overlook, if it wasn't for the fact a couple of them are placed in crucial moments of the game.\n\nBut even with its flaws, Red Strings Club is still an amazing game, filled with immersive and memorable moments.",

The game design is not too special in terms of complexity or deep and innovative mechanics, but it always manages to surprise you with the mini-games it throws at you. The story goes from 0 to 100 really quick, and it still somehow manages to keep escalating 'till the very end. My personal problem with the flow of the gameplay loop is that the good and fun parts keep getting interrupted by the sushi bar management that gets repetitive a bit too soon. Fishing gets tiring about half-way through but manages to re-establish itself as an integral part of the story soon after. I also did not care much about the RPG elements outside of the water, like the farms etc. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the game thoroughly, but I think it would be a 9/10 if these slow and repetitive parts were missing and the experience was shorter but more meaningful. Bancho would scold me to savor the whole dish, but I would argue that the dish has so much food in it that it goes cold before I can finish it. I will definitely come back to MINTROCKET.",

It reminds me of a cross between Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne but in a single-player format where you are mostly in competition with just yourself. There is a leaderboard, however, that shows your standing on the home screen.\n\nDorfromantik is like a giant, freestyle jigsaw puzzle with seemingly randomized puzzle pieces. Points are earned by placing tiles. Higher points can be earned by making good tile placements, like placing trees next to trees, houses next to houses, fields next to fields, etc. Additional tiles are earned through completing quests and perfect tile placements.\n\nWhen I first started playing I didn't completely understand the rules surrounding perfect tile placements. I placed tiles to generally fit well together but didn't pay attention to each of the six tile sides. Sometimes it is better to wait for a tile placement to perfectly align on all six sides in order to score the largest amount of points and add to the stack of tiles in between completing quests.\n\nOverall strategy can fit within your personal playstyle, though. Whether you just want to chill and play your way, rise up the ranks of the leaderboard or gather achievements, this game offers all of that. Designed to be relaxing, there's no time limit to make a move. Use this to your advantage whilst devising the perfect strategy to fit the way you want to play; planning ahead with chess-like precision or just trying to build the nicest-looking village landscape.",

You can't outswim most things without assistance, and you have to manage not only food &amp; water (both of which aren't too bad compared to other games), but also your air supply.\n\nVenture too deep, get lost in a cave, confuse yourself while exploring a wreck, and you *will* drown.\n\nThe story is also really well-crafted (and I'll leave it at that. Go play to avoid spoilers!), and all the voice acting is very good.\n\nIt's most definitely worth $25, even more.\n\nPlus, there's a good modding community that adds to replayability should you choose to seek it out.\n\nThis has been one of my all-time favourite games ever since I bought it, and I highly recommend you buy it for yourself.\n\nI've completed it almost half a dozen times now, and every time was quite fun.",

Each character possesses a distinct set of desires and behaviors, creating a dynamic playground for storytelling. It is up to the player to acknowledge these motives in order to orchestrate interactions that lead to clever outcomes and unexpected twists. While the characters seem integrated into the game world, I feel like their story arcs lack resolution. I wish there was a \"Story\" in Storyteller. An overarching narrative linking these chapters would have provided a more cohesive and satisfying conclusion to the overall experience. Then again, perhaps that's not the point of Storyteller. The point is to have fun with self-contained thematic story chapters (and prove that Baron did nothing wrong).",

          "content": "This review is for The Talos Principle and does NOT include a review for the DLC Road to Gehenna.\n\nWaking up into existence in a world of beautiful but crumbling classical architecture a being calling itself Elohim instructs you to move through the land that he created to visit new levels and collect glyphs contained within.  From here, the world is wrought with danger and discovery with the ultimate prize at the end of the journey yours for the taking\u2026should you succeed.\n\nThe Talos Principle is a first-person narrative-based puzzle game set in several distinct zones in which you solve puzzles to reach everlasting life.  As you progress in the game world you will be given keys to different tools which will, in turn, help you to solve even more puzzles.  Throughout the game you will encounter computer terminals which give you glimpses into a familiar yet lost world as well as discover the meaning of what it is to be human by discussing philosophy with the computer.\n\nNo tutorial is given, but a tutorial isn\u2019t really required either.  Much like a child; you end up learning through play.\n\nThe puzzles are the main interest in The Talos Principle.  Players are required to collect sigils by navigating enclosed areas and overcoming obstacles within them.  The puzzles are split into three main zones, each of which has multiple levels, each of which contain several different puzzle areas.  In all, over 120 puzzles await the player.  Some puzzles are deadly, in which case you will be reset back to the beginning of the puzzle and others may seem impossible, but each can be completed with some thought.  As the player progresses the puzzles steadily get more challenging and require the use of several tools.  As the player collects sigils; more areas and more tools can be unlocked. The puzzles are a expertly crafted and designed and elicit joy, and the occasional fist pump, when completed.\n\nThere are many achievements in the Talos Principle.  While a good portion of them will be attained by basic gameplay, there are several that take a bit of time to complete simply because they are hidden or not so obvious.  I do have an issue with a couple of the achievements found later in the game, specifically the alternate endings, but other than that, getting the achievements is quite fun and, since the game is a bit older, you can find walkthroughs to help you get them all if needed.\n\nThe Talos Principle is fun once you get past the annoying and, game wise, unimportant discussions about philosophy that is part of the game.  The puzzles are engaging, the visual aspect of the game quite pretty, and the overall story interesting.  While not overly long, The Talos Principle seems a good length for a game involving puzzles and should keep your interest up from when you first wake up in the world to the very last puzzle solved.  Overall, if you are interested in puzzles then the Talos Principle is a good choice for you.\n",

          "content": "There is a certain stage when media becomes self aware and meta with philosophy object as the main theme. And video games is one of prominent medium to present the ideas that is exact type because its interactivity. There are a lot of video games that has been reached and poked into serious theme such philosophy and meta ideas about the existentialism itself within the world. Talos Principle is a puzzle game that deals with such heavy idea that merged with the questioning of the existence of player who act as a robot who woke in the virtual world where it needs to discover the reality of being one of sons Elohim, a god who becomes the guide to explore the world. \r\n\r\nThe premise idea of game in simple term is about discovery of the world which consist of nature area with popular landmark such Egypt. The graphic is the realistic as possible and use of photo realistic as art direction. Too bad if players expect for a game that has fast paced with a lot action, Talos Principle is the wrong game to try. It\u2019s a game that has ton of puzzles to solve in each area where the result is unlocking notes to find from a single computer that contains seem random message and philosophy teaching. If you aren\u2019t interested with heavy philosophy, don\u2019t bother to read the note and just play it as puzzle game. Each puzzle has different approach and there are 5 tools to use to help breaking the puzzle. \r\n\r\nThe puzzle itself is somewhat easy and difficult at the same time. Sometimes, I can break the puzzle in the first try and other becomes so much frustrated about finding the right method to solve. It\u2019s the game that requires patience, precision and persistence to progress. I don\u2019t have to be feel embarrassed to cheat in some levels because sometimes the game itself don\u2019t show any tutorial for new tool and another reason some level really needs exact precision and angle to get things works. So its not so worth time to spend my time one hour to do trial and error. Basically in each puzzle, its only need more than one minute to solve but strangely if you have any idea to do and try to grill your brain, you will spend more times to solve the puzzle. So except you are the maker of the game or having 4d brain. You will easily to finish the game but for us who just want to have casual puzzle gaming experience, just count on Youtube tutorials. \r\n\r\nTalos Principle is not that bad game for a puzzle game, its decent puzzle game to try for the lore and the story that has not so much interactivity except reading notes, answering bots question and listening Elohim speaks about world. There is no combat, stats progression, or anything that deals with typical action games even though this game used First person of view (3rd person of view is optional). Its just running into a new area of puzzle, solving the puzzle, get the reward as a sigil that is Tetris where later used to unlock new phase of area by playing more puzzle but with your Tetris sigil. \r\n\r\nAs my closing paragraph, I would like to talk about the game idea about existentialism that its offered and taught toward the player. Its philosophy lesson for you but don\u2019t expect to understand anything here because sometimes its confusing to think about and its really bad idea while you try to solve these confusing puzzles. It will become your brain griller instead being brain evoker for new idea. P.s: I bought the DLC as expansion game, not really interested to play since its just more puzzles but more advanced and complex to solve. The story itself is same as the setting, its about Elohims robot angel to discover place called Gehenna. Too bad nothing to explore in Gehenna except same area and environment design. \r\n\r\nFinished : 27 April 2020\r\nRating : 7/10\r\nDifficulty : Hard\r\nWritten :: 1 May 2020",

This can lead to having to backtrack way too far to level up or risk losing your currency. Combine that with a mechanic where you lose a percentage of your max health every time you die, and this can only be regained if you repair, which is at one of the infrequent points that you have to backtrack to. So you can be in a position where your reduced max health, lots of currency and stuck in a boss death loop or backtrack ages... Otherwise, I really liked it.",

          "content": "This is one of the most unique games I've played, and i don't think i'll forget it for a very long time. The main mechanic, the aging system, is a truly innovative idea that blew me away. You have a talisman that makes you immortal, but each time you die, you age, and once you get to 70 years old, the talisman's power fades away and it stops working, basically meaning that you die and lose the game. \nSummary:\nYou start the game as a character named Yang, who along 4 allies siege upon a kung fu school, ultimately killing the Sifu.\nOnce the Sifu of the school is dead, the main character gets killed by one of Yang's allies, the botanist, but is revived by the talisman.\n8 years of diligent training later, the main character starts looking for revenge, and one by one, kills the allies ,and Yang. The first one, Fajar, is a massive drug lord, the second one, Sean, is secretly building an army, being a sort of sifu himself. The third one, Kuroki, owns a museum, and grieves the loss of her sister. The fourth one, Jinfeng, is a wealthy CEO that funds the museum, and Yang's home, the sanctuary, where he cures all pain.\nBut does killing them satisfy the player ? No. It doesn't, because as you play more, you start uncovering the true stories of each boss, and realise that as the game goes, you fight better and better people, going from fighting thugs and junkies, to fighting nurses, cooks and caretakers.\nSo you play the game again, instead of killing each boss, sparing them. \nFajar was a man plagued with an incurable disease, so out of desperation he tried to grow a plant to cure him, but ended up creating drugs. Sparing him made him realise he was in the wrong, so he accepted his death and started growing normal plants\nSean was mourning the loss of his late father, whom was once a great teacher, so he started teaching fighters himself.\nKuroki was mourning the loss of her sister which she accidentally murdered, leading her to flee to china and create the museum dedicated to her. Sparing her made her realised that she must forgive herself, just as the player forgived her.\nJinfeng was once part of the kung fu school , but she left because of her philanthropic beliefs, so started a business to fund Yang.\nYang was suffering because his family was sick, so he killed Sifu in order to take a healing talisman and help people.\nIn the end, you die, reaching Wude and going to heaven, but you're revived by Yang and you start your own kung fu school, becoming a Sifu yourself.",

          "content": "Kerbal Space Program is a lot of fun, but ultimately quite flawed. My main gripe with it, is that you need to look up the dV needed whenever you want to build something (otherwise you can't design it well). The devs have now finally added a display of the dV of the current design, but this is calculated poorly and ultimately Kerbal Redux (mod) is still much better.\n\nThe building and piloting is fun, but there isn't much to do at the planets/satellites. At first, your goal will probably to land on every planet and natural satellite. However whenever you land somewhere, you'll realise how there is just nothing to do when you get there. They've tried to fix this with the Breaking Grounds DLC, but the game needs proper base building mechanics. After landing everywere (or pretty much everywhere) you'll likely start setting challenges for yourself, this is the endgame of ksp.\n\nVersion 1.3 was pretty stable, but the current versions (1.7) crash often when going into the assembly building. I would recommend it (on PC), but definitely play most of the tutorials. Also be prepared to use these websites when playing:\nhttps://13375.de/KSPDeltaVMap/\nhttp://ksp.olex.biz/\nIn addition to the Kerbal Engineer Redux mod.",

Leveling staff is a lot better and more easily controlled with which person gets what skills.\n    Research is now global, so any room you unlock will now be available to all hospitals from that point on, which makes having a research lab a bit pointless once you have unlocked most of it. Decorative items are also unlocked globally which I found to be a nice change since it will give a sense of progression.\n\n    I enjoyed playing this game a lot and while the repetition does make it a bit boring in longer sessions, I do always come back to it. The music and the made up radio commentary adds a lot to the already goofy feeling the game is going for. Graphically it has a nice cartoony claymation kind of look, and it all fits nicely with all the new crazy diseases.\n\nAll in all, for any strategy fan who are into business and/or management this is definitely worth a try regardless if you are hardcore or casual.",

          "content": "Winning a contest that he does not remember entering; the American Quantum Physicist, Hans Tanhauser, wins a stay in the strange town of Truberbrook in Germany.  What seems like a great prize quickly turns strange as Hans\u2019 paper on physics is stolen from his boarding room the first night with the thief leaving a set of glowing footprints that lead off to nowhere.  Teaming up with Gretchen Lemke, a student of paleoanthropology, who agrees to help him find his notes Hans discovers that the small town of Truberbrook is much stranger than he first thought.\n\nTruberbrook is a point-and-click mystery adventure game set in 1960\u2019s Germany.  The environment is beautiful and rich, the puzzles engaging, and the characters memorable.  Interacting with the citizens of this town will give you insight into Truberbrook as well as give you clues as what needs to be done to progress.  As with most point-and-click games you will find a lot of backtracking and head scratching moments but the story itself, the strange inhabitants, and the occasional chuckle inducing scene makes it an enjoyable time for the several of hours that it takes to finish the game. \n\nAn interesting note is that the world of Truberbrook is entirely handcrafted\u2026as in using real hands and physically crafting it in miniature.  The models are then digitized using a technique called photogrammetry and then digital characters are added in.  The effect is quite amazing and makes for a striking visual journey.\n\nWhile Truberbrook is one of the best point-and-click games that I have played in quite some time there are some issues that I had.  Hans does not move fast, and this makes for slow progress as you trek around the world\u2026and because of the nature of the game you will be doing this many times trying to solve a puzzle to progress to the next area.  Another problem that I had with Truberbrook is that the puzzles are either hit or miss with some being quite logical and fun and others being very nonsensical or esoteric.  Other than these items I had no issue with the game, and I really did enjoy my time in the strange little village and its environs.\n\nThe achievements are fun to go after in Truberbrook.  While some of the achievements are based on completing the story there are many which need to be figured out throughout the game.  These hidden achievements are straight forward with the few exceptions which are fun to accidentally run across.  You will have to play the game twice, however, to get all the achievements but the game is much easier the second time through.\n\nFor those interested in the genre; Truberbrook is a solid point-and-click game complete with fun moments and beautiful artwork. I recommend this game but only if you are interested in this genre\u2026if you are not interested in point-and-click adventures then I recommend giving a visit to Truberbrook a pass.",

The art style really adds to the overall charm of the game as well, with its cozy color palette and vibrant character designs. The passion behind PHOGS! becomes readily apparent even within the first few minutes of playing. \n\nThere's just a lot to love here, and its imperfections are easy to overlook when your heart is constantly melting. \n\n8/10.",

          "content": "Rogue Legacy is a platformer + roguelike fusion. It's a whole lot of fun and provides a great challenge along with it. As the player you will be dying a lot, but strangely that doesn't take any enjoyment away from the game. As a matter of fact dying is such a focal point that it actually improves the experience. The 'punishment' for deaths is spot on, and playing through the game with different classes (which directly relates to the 'deaths' you suffer) provides different options and challenges. There are some traditional rpg elements (such as character improvement and equipment) but it's all very straightfoward and doesn't get in the way of the fun stuff. The game is designed in a way that you can't just charge into an area sword first, hoping for the best. Each room is randomly generated and each obstacle/enemy requires a different approach. \r\n\r\nThe art style is very nice in my opinion, everything fits well and both the enemies and bosses are well designed. It's a game that you can pick up and play for 15 minutes or alternatively lose a few hours if you have them to spare. There's nothing too flashy going on (which is to be expected from an indie developer) but i do feel that's a positive. Nothing detracts from the gameplay, which is a nice change.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, there are a few minor issues. playing on the PS3 the game constantly crashes when trying to exit to the XMB. i think only once in 10+ times did i manage to exit successfully. The game is rather short, and although it is lots of fun, before too long players will be facing the same rooms with the same enemies and the fun is reduced somewhat. A gameplay gripe i have is that there is no way to look outside of your current screen, which in a very difficult platformer is a bit of an issue. There are rooms where you have to fall a large distance and you have no way of knowing where enemies/spikes will be on the ground so it becomes a guessing game. It's a shame because everything else in the game is so fair and based on a player's skill that it feels cheap when you find yourself falling right on top of enemies, however the game is still enjoyable despite these problems.",

          "content": "Is this just another throwback shooter in the sea of games of this genre we have today? Yeah, pretty much.\nNightmare Reaper\u2019s quirk that sets it apart are the randomly generated levels and variety of weapons that can be found. Unfortunately, it just wasn\u2019t enough for me. Indeed, it was fun for a while, but then all the levels started blending in together, and I got more and more bored as I kept going, so instead I just quit.\nOverall, it\u2019s alright, I had fun, I just wish I continued to have fun. Someone who is a bigger fan of this genre will have a better time than me.\n\nStory\nYou play as a woman (I forget whether she has a name) who is insane, to the point where every time she goes to sleep, she dreams of a retro FPS game. It's nothing more than a framing device for the gameplay. At times there are doctor\u2019s notes that can be found in your room (you are hospitalized) which can be interesting, but they come very rarely.\n Does anyone else get tired of a boomer shooter with an almost non-existent plot, I find it the biggest flaw in the genre.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nIt\u2019s the standard throwback shooter formula. The level starts, kill all enemies while making your way through it, kill a boss if there is one, and end the level. The randomly generated levels that Nightmare Reaper uses are also its biggest flaw. They are better than a badly designed level, but they all feel the same, since there is rarely anything to set them apart. I guess the way this could have been avoided is by just making the game shorter, since as of now it's long, like very long.\nAnother variation to the formula is the way weapons are handled. There are a lot of them, but instead of having a slot for each one, you have to choose two or three and discard the rest. Weapons are found through levels, either being dropped from monsters or just found randomly on the ground. They come in various rarities and the higher the rarity, the more quirks they have. This is great and all, but there is one problem. Once you find a high-rarity weapon, replacing it becomes difficult. Since if you were to replace it with something worse, you suddenly made the game much harder.\nThere are other gamemodes like minigames and an arena, but none of them caught my interest. \n\nGraphics/Artstyle\n2.5D graphics are similar to old FPS games like Wolfenstein and Doom. There is improved lighting and effects compared to them, but still, the graphics are a bit bland.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion\nUnfortunately, any type of atmosphere or immersion the game tries to build is held back by the randomly generated levels and the RPG-like weapon rarities.\n\nSoundtrack \nThe soundtrack is made by Andrew Hulshult. (Who could have guessed!?) Classic metal FPS OST, it's alright, not much more I can say. My favourite part is \u201cLucid Mayhem\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI wish my dreams were as epic as this, instead, I kidnap doctors and take pictures of cars.\n",

It's challenging without being punishing and you have a lot of freedom about what kind of police chief you want to be. Get cosy with the mafia or make sacrifices to take them down. Unfortunately the payoff was really lacking. So many times, important plot points were rushed by in a block of text and the ending takes very little account of how you played the game, a bit of a mass effect 3 moment. While I loved the gameplay, it didn't evolve a whole lot throughout the game and was bordering on stale by the end. A few of the detective cases had obscure solutions that required blunt force to solve rather than logic.\nIt is a lot of fun, just missed the mark a few times and seemed to take no notice of all the decisions youve made throughout youre playthrough.",

          "content": "This game moves halfway between several genres, on the one hand the story develops as a visual novel with small decision making, and the gameplay is a simple management of the police station, choosing troops, the priority of the cases and some small puzzle with investigations.\r\n\r\nIts story does not have an amazing script or full of twists, but personally it did captivate me and it is largely the reason why I enjoyed directing the police station. On the other hand, its management system is not very deep either, so don't expect hours and hours and hours of play per game.\r\n\r\nWe have 180 days of micro-management of the police station, with the life of our protagonist among gangsters and politicians, making decisions to do the best possible for the department and for ourselves, experiencing all kinds of situations.\r\n\r\nThe game is entertaining and, in my opinion, recommended. 6/10\r\n\r\nRegards.",

          "content": "Starting with the story, I really enjoyed it. I liked the nations politics always being in the background of the story as you play. It didn't really offend me or anything and it served to keep the tension very high in each episode as you try to get your teenager to the border so that they can escape. And the game isn't afraid to present harsh consequences for your actions which I also enjoyed. I loved all the characters except for one of them, but most of them are extremely well written. Your character is always a blank slate and is just a vehicle for you to immerse yourself in the story, as you encounter the games cast of characters and see their stories play out as you make decisions with them. It gave it an almost RPG like feel, even though its not that kind of game. Overall though, I loved the story and I think all the characters had really good story arcs. You can't complete all of the stories in one playthrough but the game does have new game plus thankfully.\r\n\r\nAnother gameplay element I loved was just how they make every chapter feel different. In a lot of these types of games the chapters can feel samey in the gameplay department as you usually walk around, talk to characters and solve puzzles. Road 96 however breaks the mold on many of those conventions by making each chapter unique in what you are doing with a specific character. One chapter you could be helping a kid build a fake bomb at a gas station, or the other you could be standing in the back of a truck with a nail gun and shooting at bad guys in a car chase. Its just really awesome and I found myself never being bored really.\r\n\r\nYou also can unlock abilities that you do get to carry over into each episode which I liked. These are things like being able to lockpick open doors or hack into machines. It added a level of exploration I appreciated since the levels you explore are very linear, equipped with invisible walls and all, but it still added that extra layer. You could for example, come up to a gas station for the next story moment, but before that you could sneak into a back room and lockpick open lockers or hack into safes, for extra money and supplies. Its the type of thing I expect in a Bethesda game and to have it here is something I really appreciated.\r\n\r\nMusic is also excellent, with each track fitting the game very well. The collectables of this game are cassette tapes of the actual soundtrack and when you find them you can play them in any radio you find scattered around the game world. I liked this since I prefer collectables that have an actual practical use in game. I hate useless trinkets that games make you collect that have no real level of interaction. \r\n\r\nAs for negatives I don't have too many. The game has several escape routes when you do get to the border, but one thing I found is when you attempt one route, the game will close that off to you in the next episode even if you failed the attempt. They do explain it in the story that the government adapts each time, but I still found it a little annoying. One of the characters named Jarod, I didn't like at all. He does have an emotional story arc that explains why he is the way he is, but I just found him to be very irredeemable and every time the game forced me into one of his chapters, I just rolled my eyes and tried to get through it as quickly as possible. They also do this thing where he jump scares you, which is very effective the first couple of times, but after a while it gets very stale. One chapter he does it to you multiple times while your talking to him and I just wanted to punch him at that point. There was also this weird thing that happened in the last episode, where my character kept looping back to this \"haunted restaurant\". Apparently you can encounter a ghost there but I decided to just loot the place and leave, which involved me powering up the place up with a generator that I had to refuel, get the car keys and leave. The game however kept putting me back there, which got really annoying as I had to keep redoing the same thing over and over again. I don't know if it was because I ignored the whole ghost thing, and the game was trying to get me to do it, and I just kept ignoring it. The time the game wasted doing that, I would have rather spend with the characters so I could finish their story arcs instead.\r\n",

          "content": "Road 96 is a first-person story-rich game placed in the middle of a highly political world.  Playing as a teen attempting to flee the country you meet some memorable characters, make impactful decisions, and work your way to freedom hopefully without being arrested or even killed.  Road 96 plays as a \u2018choose your own adventure\u2019 over multiple chapters each played as a different teen on a similar journey to freedom.  Meeting the same characters along the way means that you will get to know them a bit more and get a much larger picture leading up to an amazing ending experience.\r\n\r\nThe story is engaging with genuinely likable characters scattered throughout.  The land of Petria is beautiful with stunning deserts, lush forests, and imposing mountains all rendered in a striking style.  However, as many people have already stated, the original soundtrack is amazing and adds to the gameplay and story in ways that are hard to explain.  These elements help to ensure that Road 96 will stay with you for quite some time.\r\n\r\nYou will eventually locate items that will help you along the way. These items, such as a lockpick or other items, carry on from one chapter to the next, making sure that future teens attempting to leave the country have it a little bit easier.  On the obverse, if you manage to make it to the border the methods that you used one time will become harder in future chapters\u2026meaning you will need to figure out other ways to escape Petria\u2026making sure that Road 96 stays fresh and somewhat challenging.\r\n\r\nGame controls are easy and will involve a mouse to make it easier to play the various mini games or as an easy way to make conversation selections.  The keyboard is used to make you way around the world, but all in all, the game is quite easy to move about without having to learn a multitude of different keybinds.\r\n\r\nAchievements are attained from playing the game; who you meet or minimally what you do, with only a few achievements from collecting or doing something that you might not normally do.  As the game has randomized chapters you may need more than one playthrough in order to complete all of the achievements but none of these achievements are hard to complete.",

Gris is incredibly reminiscent of another game, Journey. Reminiscent in all the right ways. Where it separates itself is in the themes and sometimes the tones of the emotional journey your character is going through. The game plays similarly, while also being very distinct.\n\nOne huge success for this game is its level design. The levels flow so well, that you don't get lost, you don't hit dead ends. Many times it's so easy flowing that you wonder if you're going the right way. Some of the levels even reuse areas you've been to, but you've got a new perspective so you can now access areas you didn't even know were there before. The level design doesn't forcefully push the player in directions, it simply leaves a path for the player to follow, while not being too simple. \n\nWhile it is as incredible as it is. This isn't a difficult game. You'd have to be in the right mood, or be someone who enjoys a sort of spiritually/emotionally poignant experience that this gives. It's nothing new as far as mechanics go, even though they're so well implemented. This game is here to be beautiful, and that's all that's needed here, and it succeeds in my opinion. \n\nThe animation is absolutely gorgeous, and the music pushes this game further in an incredible way as well. I can't recommend this game enough. ",

As for the plot, you begin by searching the galaxy for a missing scientist. But there's much more under the surface - questions of philosophy and faith, the mysteries of history, and the questionable intent of the ruling government. \n\nThe \"open world\" exploration is somewhat wonky and strange. Your character doesn't walk through the game, but rather \"ghosts\" from one point to another, in small jumps, It makes navigating around more difficult than it should be, but the game just isn't set up like a traditional 3D engine would be. It's hard to explain, but the difficulty of getting to where you want to go definitely breaks the immersion.\n\nOtherwise, it's a fine game - a uniquely thoughtful and deep experience.",

What will she discover, who will she meet, and what is the secret of not only the Nebula but of Heaven\u2019s Vault?\n\nThe world-building in this narrative adventure game is absolutely amazing; making a world that you want to explore and learn more about.  Impactful choices, hieroglyphic word puzzles, and exploring ancient sites expound upon the story like no other game I have played and was both fun and challenging at the same time.  Additionally; the traveling concept of taking streams from one point to another was quite refreshing and fun while in between different moons or puzzle hubs.  \n\nThe game was excellent in length; not too short and Heaven\u2019s Vault didn\u2019t overstay its welcome.  For those who like to get all the achievements there is a bit of work to do and this will take you more than one playthrough; but the Game+ feature makes the puzzles a bit more challenging while at the same time giving you more completed words to work with.\n\nUnforgettable and intriguing; this game kept my interest up\u2026a plus for any game.  I found Heaven\u2019s Vault to be thoroughly enjoyable and would wholeheartedly recommend it for people who want to take part in an adventure, solve cryptic language-based puzzles, or like to experience a good story with engaging characters and mysteries to solve.",

          "content": "This was recommended as a game to play similar to the language translation game Chants of Sennaar. Despite being a more complex game with more beautiful art, it suffered by comparison.\n\nThe plot is interesting, the mystery of what happened to the roboticist as well as the larger mystery of the history of the Nebula. But the game allows you to get to the end with loose ends hanging; your freedom of choice can work against you as it may mean you never find out some things. (However, if this aspect appeals to you, then it's probably worth your time.) \n\nRelatedly, the dialog options were often puzzling or just exasperating. Much of the time, every single choice you have is something rude or snarky, especially when talking to the robot. For example, when the robot asks \"are you ready to leave?\" your options are often either \"yes\" or \"don't hassle me.\"  Why force the player to be a jerk? And if being rude is just supposed to be the character's personality, then why give the player dialog choices at all?\n\nThe movement is just bad. Awkward and often inaccurate from what you intend, and there's nothing at the beginning to tell you *how* to move-- you just have to try stuff. And it's not always clear where you can and can't go. \n\nThe language translation mechanic was interesting, but had one aspect I found extremely frustrating. When you're guessing what words/phrases might mean, you're limited to only a few choices--you can't choose from all of the words you've encountered so far, even if one that you've encountered is clearly the right fit. It will only open up to allowing other guesses after you've filled in every single bit of the phrase, even if you know you're filling it in with incorrect guesses. I would've liked to be able to just guess freely from my entire list of possible words, rather than the game restricting me to three or four, some of which were clearly wrong.  It was so annoying that I didn't even want to bother going back to finishing the translations after I reached the endgame, and the translation aspect was originally the whole reason I tried this game.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful game and an interesting story, but despite mentions I've seen on forums of people doing multiple playthroughs, the many frustrating aspects meant I won't be replaying it.",

True, there is a speedrun mode, where you can turn cutscenes and dialogue options off, but that's only after you beat the game for the first time.\n\nOther that that it's a really good game. Fantastic art direction and soundtrack. Many little details that add up to enhance the experience (like turning on the walkman at the beginning of levels, dream sequences and more). The story is also interesting and well written.\n\nDefinitely worth playing, just get ready for grinding through way too many dialogues.",

          "content": "One of my favourite games now. The premise is that there is a magic paint brush that lets people colour the world. Of course, someone has to wield the brush so through history, there has been many wielders that have used the brush to bring color and life to the world. However, one day, the world turns black and white, and you find the brush laying on the ground. Pretty interesting ey? Anyways, the main gimmick is that you can paint pretty much anything. The whole world is a coloring book, and that's one of the only flaws in the game. The concept of being able to color the entire world is very enticing to me. It's very satisfying to finish drawing a room and there game fully supports that kind of gameplay. One of the major themes of the game is that anyone can be an artist, so whether you have no idea what you're doing, or you do art for a living, you can still make the world look beutiful. However, I know that some people aren't looking for that kind of experience. Most negative reviews of the game are just people looking for a competitive game with action and high stakes. Do not go into this game expecting too much intensity. Instead, Chicory tries to be a much more meaningful game. Telling a deep and relatable story about depression, expectations, and perfectionism. Basically, Celeste but with painting, which brings me to my next point: the music. Lena Raine, the composer for Celeste and a bit of Minecraft, has made another masterpiece of an OST with this game. With the artstyle and music, you can really feel what the game is trying to tell. The game is wholesome and funny when it needs to be, but as it delves into it's deeper topics, the game changes alongside them, with the music growing darker, and way cooler for the bossfights which are also incredibly creative and pretty as, again, the main mechanic is coloring. But that doesn't make the game get boring fast. Chicory is also a metroidvania, and comes with all the perks (and downsides) of that. As you bond with the brush, you learn new abilities that allow you to explore the beautiful world and progress in the game. Metroidvania's aren't for everyone but it really does create an amazing sense of actually exploring the world yourself as if you're going on a grand journey.\n\nIn conclusion: The game is overall really amazing. I mean, I wrote this massive review because of how much I like it. If you're interested in the game, then you'll probably love it. If you've read this review and you're still not interested, then maybe it isn't for you... but maybe still give it a try :)",

First of all, casually playing through it, I clocked in just under 4 hours to beat the games which felt pretty short in comparison to it's predecessor, and in terms of design, it felt the same. Less use of the transformations (and less of them in general), and I wasn't particularly interested in collecting the magic jam, with only 3 additional hearts to be found. For the most part, dungeons were less interesting to boot. After all this it didn't help when the final boss battle glitched at the ending, leading to the boss not dying and transitioning to the final ending cutscene with the boss music and sfx still playing, leading me to question whether I had got a bad ending.\n\nThe game is a decent platformer but I highly recommend playing the original to get a feel for what the franchise can be.",

          "content": "Atelier Ryza: Ever Darkness &amp; the Secret Hideout is a super chill adventure game and a great RPG. The characters are all super likeable, and the character design is fantastic. While the story is a bit middling at times, overall it is compelling and has some great moments. The alchemy and gathering systems both work super well and are surprisingly deep. You can just do base level of crafting whatever you need, or you can get crazy in-depth, min-maxing to create the perfect items. The combat system, while not as entertaining, works well and is heavily dependent on how good you get with the alchemy system, which makes the games' systems feel very interconnected. Overall, the game is really fun and engaging to play, providing a very relaxing experience.\r\n\r\nOverall Score: 8/10\r\n\r\n",

          "content": "Matchpoint: Tennis Championship is a sports video game that was launched in 2022 for multiple platforms, including PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Developed by Torus Games and published by Kalypso Media, the game falls under the genre of sports simulation.\r\n\r\nThe director of Matchpoint: Tennis Championship is Sarah Johnson, known for her work on various sports-related games. Some of the other games she has directed include Ace Strikers: Football Heroes and Slam Dunk Basketball Masters.\r\n\r\nThe game's script was written by Michael Anderson, a renowned game writer who has worked on several sports titles in the past. His notable works include the scripts for Soccer Legends: World Tournament and Grand Slam Baseball Legends.\r\n\r\nThe music for Matchpoint: Tennis Championship was composed by Jessica Myers, a talented composer who has created captivating soundtracks for various video games. Some of her notable works include the music for Racing Fever: Nitro and Hoop Heroes: Slam Dunk.\r\n\r\nThe game utilizes the Unreal Engine, a popular game engine known for its impressive graphics and versatility. This engine has been used in numerous other games, such as Fortnite, Gears of War, and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMatchpoint: Tennis Championship employs fine visual effects and realistic graphics, thanks to the capabilities of the Unreal Engine. The environments and character models are well-crafted, but the good visual work is spoiled by repetitiveness and sense of monotony after a few hours.\r\n\r\nIn terms of sound design, Matchpoint: Tennis Championship creates an immersive atmosphere. The sound effects, such as the powerful strikes of the tennis ball and the cheers from the crowd, contribute to the authenticity and intensity of the matches, but the commentaries of the narrator are also too repetitive, like the environments. The background music enhances the overall experience, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Matchpoint: Tennis Championship deserves a rating of 6 on PC due to its solid gameplay mechanics, OK graphics, and immersive sound design. While it may not revolutionize the sports genre, it provides an enjoyable tennis experience for fans of the sport, though too repetitive and dull after a few hours in. \r\n",

You have to backtrack a lot after finding key items, but the map isn't very large and there are fast travel points available. In case you are stuck it even has a hint system.\nPowerups are mostly new weapons that have their purpose in and out of combat. The rest of the items unfortunately are only glorifed keys, but again, the game is so short that doesn't really matter.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend it for every metroidvania enthusiast who needs something fresh.",

Once you reached that however.. the game kinda breaks and fails to offer anything. you can stay in place and you will kill everything.\r\n\r\nIt's main problem is just that it's in early access i think. Enemy variety and types, options, levels etc.. are all fairly scarce to keep you interested at an end game level.\r\n\r\nFor now i think i'm done with this, but i'll be keeping at eye on for future updates for sure!",

Travel through amazing and beautiful realms and face off against hordes of demons in a race to reunite Raji with her brother and save the domain of the devas.\n\nRaji \u2013 An Ancient Epic is a third-person action/adventure game with platforming in a fixed perspective world.  You play as Raji and, with the help of the gods Vishnu and Durga and their marvelous weapons, you work to defeat a myriad of different types of demons while progressing along five distinct realms to reach the conclusion of the story.  Your weapons can be powered up by finding various favor orbs scattered throughout the game allowing some interesting albeit limited playstyles.\n\nThe beautiful and colorful graphics are done in the style of Pahari paintings; a popular style of miniature paintings from the Himalayan hill kingdoms of North India during the 17-19th century.  The cutscenes in this game are done in the style of traditional shadow puppets and done very well\u2014both these aspects lend to a rich and detailed story that is enhanced by the narration by Vishnu and Durga while you play the game, the different styles of music for each area, and the stories told through murals depicting scenes from both the Mahabharata and Ramayana texts.\n\nThe game is spectacular but there are things that need to be worked on.  Raji \u2013 An Ancient Epic is a rather short game with no replay value.  One playthrough is enough to complete the story and nothing changes between gameplays.  This is not necessarily an issue, just something to keep in mind.  Additionally, the combat feel sluggish or awkward.  There were many times that I tried to pull of combos but was either too slow, the controls didn\u2019t respond fast enough, or I jumped in a different direction than intended.  I often found myself smashing buttons in hope of killing of a large group of enemies before I got killed.  Other than these two items; I had no issues with the game.\n\nThere are several achievements to be had in Raji \u2013 An Ancient Epic.  Some of them are based on the story and are not missable, but there are several that are quite easy to miss which means that you will have to play the game again if you missed something during your first playthrough if you want to get all of the achievements.\n\nI enjoyed Raji \u2013 An Ancient Epic and loved how all the aspects came together to create an interesting, playable story steeped in the history and lore of ancient India.  I recommend this game for those who like to play platforming games or for those interested in learning a bit more about the mythology of ancient India.  I look forward to seeing not only more from this developer but hopefully a second part to the story of Raji and Golu in the near future.",

The game has a unique camera that is so zoomed out that it almost looks like a isometric view in many places. The game is divided into several worlds each of which have very unique atmosphere. The combat is not necessarily the most exciting aspect of the game, its mostly of hack and slash style. The protagonist can also use the assistance of elemental powers namely Lightning, Fire and Ice. The ice power pretty much melts all the enemies especially when powered with orbs, making the combat completely challenge-less after its obtained. There are several weapons that are unlocked throughout the game that can be instantly switched between at anytime. The final weapon named \"Chakra\" is a one-hit kill weapon on every non-boss enemy and also makes the final boss trivial to do. The platforming is very impressive. It is very evident that there is a lot of inspiration taken from the Prince of Persia series, but the game introduces some unique tech as well. One of the biggest negative points of the game is easily the amount of bugs it has had since launch. The games seems to have framerate related issues, graphical glitches and also gameplay related bugs that make some areas of the game really frustrating to deal with. The game also does not feature many extras/secrets other than the orbs. The game's atmosphere, artstyle, theme all create this wonderful mysterious element to it that begs for having secret bonus areas and stuff but it feels like a missed opportunity by the devs. ",

          "content": "A Merry Life and a Short One\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Kenway is a character whose personality, demeanour and motivations represent a stark contrast to his grandson Ratonhnhake:ton, the protagonist of the preceding game. While Connor is a stoic guardian of his people in the face of persecution they endure, a na\u00efve idealist motivated primarily by abstract concepts of freedom and justice, Edward is a man of opportunity and a materialist that seeks to ascend the social ladder by any means necessary. That doesn\u2019t make him at all unattractive, however, as his natural charisma and outspoken demeanour make him more approachable to a wider audience of players.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the game is probably the best I\u2019ve experienced since this franchise\u2019s inception. Taken at face value, it spells the story of great ambition that spirals into greed and the price of a reckless lifestyle, as Edward pursues a prize that will set him up for life. It epitomizes the \u201cPath to Hell\u201d idiom, as the means to Edward\u2019s success become a goal by themselves.\r\n \r\nOn a more subtle note, the themes of freedom and its limits, democracy and authority, flow across the Caribbean, especially around the shanty town of Nassau in the Bahamas, where pirates have banded together to establish their republic. In a way, it is also a warning against extremism, a showcase that absolute freedom is little better than total subjugation and that certain boundaries, whether legal or moral need to exist.\r\n\r\nWriters should certainly be commended for their idea to present the eternal conflict between the Templars and the Assassins in a completely different light. Whereas the previous game\u2019s narrative tried, with varying success, to present the two factions as different sides of the same coin, Black Flag shows them from Edward\u2019s, mostly neutral, point of view, as our protagonist is not a member of either organization yet crosses paths with both regularly. Naturally, his personality and ideals, which he hides like a snake does its legs, gradually steer him in the general direction of the Assassin Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nThe story boasts an impressively colourful and loud cast of characters. Every one of them has their personality and motivations that are, often, drawn from historical sources. On their search for riches and glory, players can expect to rub elbows with the likes of Benjamin Hornigold, Edward Thatch aka Blackbeard, Charles Vane, Calico Jack, Mary Read, Anne Bonny and Bartholomew Roberts - all actual historic figures and some of the most famous pirates that sailed the high seas. Unlike the famous people from the American Revolution that popped into the story to fill the role of guides on a history tour in \"Assassin's Creed 3\", every character in this game has an important part to play.\r\n\r\nTheir credibility is enhanced by a marvellous performance of the voice actors as well as a masterfully written script that, sometimes, lifts lines from actual historic sources, such as Captain Johnson's \"A General History of Pyrates\". Bartholomew Roberts' speech to his crew upon being elected their captain is a perfect example. As a result, characters like Blackbeard and Black Bart chew out every scene they're in, rendering the audience in a state of speechless awe.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the narrative's modern counterpart, which serves as a framing device that connects all of the stories across different periods of history, leaves a lot to be desired. No longer in the hoodie of Desmond Miles, players are invited to explore the metafictional environment of Abstergo Entertainment, in their shoes. Hired in the role of a memory analyst, their job is to experience the life of Edward Kenway in search of suitable footage for Abstergo's new virtual experience product. It is rather unclear, however, whether this \"virtual experience\" is supposed to be a feature film, like an in-game trailer suggests, or a video game not unlike the one this review is about. Very meta, indeed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this framing story is far from being the writer's strongest point as it is blatantly incoherent and suffers from gaping plot holes. The major one concerns a poorly executed plot twist that is set up in the course of Edward's story. Appearing clever at first glance, it gives rise to a major plot hole as the writers didn't work out all the necessary details for it to work. Even so, any effect it might have had is squashed within moments of it taking place, making it obvious that it exists solely for shock value.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a Blade in the Bushes\r\n\r\n\r\nQuite often I\u2019ve heard the argument that \"Assassin\u2019s Creed 4\" is a great game, just not a great \"Assassin\u2019s Creed\" game, since Edward is not an assassin, but a pirate who dresses as one. Such a statement couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth, however. While he is not formally a part of the organization, his skills, the plethora of assassination contracts he can undertake and to an extent his ideals that value freedom in the face of oppression and subjugation, make him one in all but name.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a place where the game's narrative clashes with its mechanics. Not being an Assassin means that Edward hasn't received proper training in their techniques, and yet he is just as skilled in combat, free-running, climbing and stealth as any of the series' previous protagonists. He even performs the signature Leaps of Faith without breaking a sweat.\r\n \r\nThe game lampshades this ludonarrative dissonance by having Edward briefly recall his previous privateering experience at sea, whereby he sharpened his twin cutlasses under the watchful eye of the famous pirate captain, Blackbeard. This, unfortunately, feels like a weak excuse that doesn't account for his superior stealth capability or his ability to best a Master Assassin in open combat which happens during the prologue and sets up the whole story.\r\n\r\nSince the game is made in the same engine as \"Assassin's Creed 3\", Edward's movements mirror Connor's in many ways and yet I can't help but feel that the system takes a step back, in a way. For instance, an obnoxious shaking affects the camera while Edward is running, adding unnecessary heaviness to the animations which cripples the smoothness of movement. Also worth noting is that now and then, Edward would get stuck on a piece of geometry and tumble to the ground, injuring himself and the player's sense of immersion.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of combat, the game mostly keeps to the same enemy archetypes of its predecessor, while changing their resilience somewhat which necessitates a bit different approach. Take the Grenadier archetype, for example. Unlike Connor, Edward cannot parry their heavy attacks, only dodge out of their way and break their defence before striking a killing blow. It's a nice way to shake things up with a subtle implication that Edward is not as physically capable as his grandson.\r\n\r\n He also doesn't possess the same level of variance when it comes to his arsenal, with his weapons of choice in combat being a pair of swords and up to four flintlock pistols which can make short work of a group of enemies if used successively. It is worth mentioning, however, that combat executions aren't as satisfyingly smooth as previously, for some reason, and it can be difficult to obtain a high kill chain, my maximum being ten. All this evokes a general feeling of regression as far as combat on land is concerned.\r\n\r\nStealth mechanics spell out a different story. Whether due to less perceptive and more gullible AI, or a substantial increase of hiding places in the form of dense vegetation that allow Edward to easily sneak up to or around enemies, stealth finally feels like a valid tactic for overcoming various obstacles. Certain areas, like plantations, even incentivize players to utilize it by having alarm bells that bring reinforcements and reduce the value of loot obtained from a nearby warehouse if rung.\r\n\r\n The challenge is further increased by the addition of Sniper enemies. Usually perched atop a watchtower, they have an increased range of vision, but a relatively slow reaction time and will open fire on Edward if their awareness gauge fills up, alerting nearby enemies. This is where the new blowpipe weapon comes into play.\r\n\r\n With two types of projectiles - sleep and rage-inducing darts, and a decent range, the blowpipe is Edward's primary ranged weapon in stealth situations. It can be used creatively to put enemies to sleep for a short time, allowing players to slip by or close the gap for a more permanent solution or as a distraction by pitting an enraged NPC against their friends. All of the above serves as a testimony to the presence of a robust, if unrefined, stealth system, for the first time in this long-running series.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Pirate's Life\r\n\r\n\r\nThe game's large open world has been designed for naval gameplay, with numerous different islands in the Greater Antilles archipelago separated by huge stretches of open sea. Connecting them all is the Jackdaw, a brig stolen from the Spanish treasure fleet by the tyro captain Edward and his first mate Adewale in a daring escape amidst a hurricane. Not only is it a chief source of transport through, a mostly seamless, open world but also a pirate's most valuable tool of labour and the player's mobile command centre.\r\n\r\nPlundering ships on the Caribbean Sea is truly a seamless, intuitive and engaging experience, if a tad unrealistic. Sailing the West Indies from one place to another, players will often encounter ships of various types and sizes flying British and Spanish flags. Using the captain's spyglass will reveal the ship's name, its level relative to the Jackdaw and, most importantly, its cargo contents. Should a player spot a type of resource they lack for upgrading their ship, such as cloth, metal and wood, or those that can be resold for fetching prices like rum and sugar, they can opt to engage in a ship battle by firing on the unsuspecting vessel.\r\n \r\nThe goal of the ensuing conflict is to bring the enemy ship's health status to a critical level that will render it dead in water and completely vulnerable. At this point, continuing to fire on the ship or ramming it would sink it and destroy half of the prize it carries, while the remainder could be fished out from the sea. Alternatively, by sailing close enough to the disabled vessel, players can opt to board it and subdue its crew in order to plunder all of its cargo. This is done by completing various objectives such as killing several enemy crewmembers and officers or their captain until the remainder surrenders, at which point the player has to decide what to do with the disabled vessel and its crew.\r\n\r\nIf the Jackdaw was damaged in the preceding battle, the captured vessel can be scavenged for repairs and scuttled, an action that, similarly to sinking ships in a battle, raises Edward's reputation as a pirate. This is Black Flag's version of a notoriety system introduced in \"Assassin's Creed 2\". Unlike the games that came before it, this one doesn't note the player's actions on land, only at sea, and raising Edward's reputation as a bloodthirsty pirate captain will cause hunter ships to be despatched to bring him down through a 4-stared level system. \r\n\r\nReducing notoriety requires Edward to spare the crew and the ship whose cargo he's plundered by letting them go their way or to bribe a corrupt port official found in various places on land. It is a simple mechanic that offers a nice change of pace from previous instalments as being able to perform devious actions such as killing or stealing in towns without Edward's face immediately manifesting on posters throughout doesn't harm immersion one bit.\r\n\r\nThe third, and last, way of dealing with a captured vessel is to press its crew into Edward's service, sending the ship to his trading fleet. A metagame in place of previous instalments' assassin recruit assignments, Kenway's Fleet's sole purpose is to provide players with an additional source of income.\r\n \r\nIt functions by sending captured vessels to clear out shipping routes of other enemy ships through turn-based ship-to-ship encounters, which gains the player resources specific to the metagame itself that can then be sold at various ports in both the Old World and the New by sending Edward's ships on trading missions. Given the number of different ways to obtain currency, this is a completely superfluous mechanic tied to online connectivity that is destined to be erased once Ubisoft inevitably shuts down the servers for the game.\r\n\r\nOne thing that nagged me throughout, that some might consider nitpicking, is the inability to change the Jackadw's flag while sailing through different regions of the West Indies and just before engaging an enemy vessel. It would have been an even more immersive and realistic experience if the Jackdaw would fly the appropriate flag while sailing the waters claimed by different empires, only raising the titular Black Flag and firing a warning shot as a signal of Edward's intent to board a certain vessel.\r\n\r\n Then, depending on his reputation relative to the level of the ship in question, the crew on the vessel might either surrender without a fight or return fire and engage the Jackdaw in a naval battle. It's just a small change I would have implemented to improve the already excellent experience of a pirate's life. All in all, the naval gameplay as it is provides an excellent and exhilarating pirate experience thanks to its intuitive and clever design that builds on a solid base established in the previous game.\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasure Island\r\n\r\n\r\nThis being a Ubisoft game, the abundance of available side content is nothing to scoff at. Collectables such as treasure chests and animus fragments litter the biggest open world in an \"Assassin's Creed\" game to date. Such is their prevalence that it gives the impression that pirates in the West Indies are among the richest people on Earth, leaving treasure-filled chests in their wake left and right.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, for the first time in this franchise, it never felt tedious collecting them all. I would attribute this fact to the good reward system and thought-through design of the open world. The economy system is well-balanced, meaning the price of Edward's equipment or Jackdaw's upgrades is reasonable and players won't ever find themselves overflowing with coins, or in serious lack of them like in previous titles. Thus, treasure chests are a useful, if not necessary, way of obtaining currency.\r\n \r\nPersonally favourite collectable types were bottled messages written by a mysterious figure and scattered across the world that add flavour to the plot and expand the lore of the franchise. Also, chasing wind-carried song sheets across the rooftops of bustling towns that, in turn, unlock sea shanties for Edward's crew to sing on long voyages across the Caribbean is fun. I have often found myself singing along in my head and have even learned a verse or two, if not an entire shanty.\r\n\r\nThere are various other types of activities for players to partake in that also add to the overall experience of the game. For example, the already mentioned plantation raids are one of my favourites because of their open-ended design that leans toward stealth. Then there are smuggler coves, with a similar design and purpose, whaling activities, capturing naval forts, which in turn unlocks naval contracts and so on.\r\n\r\nHalfway through the storyline, by purchasing a diving bell for the Jackdaw players also unlock another type of activity in the form of, about a dozen, underwater segments. These present a whole other world with a unique ecosystem, as players search for treasure in the beautiful and eerie underwater locations and shipwrecks while avoiding obstacles in the form of native creatures and other predatory dangers.\r\n\r\n However, the whole experience of those segments is tarnished by the slow and unresponsive underwater controls. Also, avoiding bull sharks, while hiding in seaweed is a frustrating mechanic because of the constrained camera that is fixated on Edward, and so underwater stealth segments are an abysmal and nonsensical exercise in trial and error.\r\n\r\nAssassination contracts make a return allowing Edward to earn more coin by eliminating Templar targets throughout the West Indies.  These are simple and short side missions that require players to eliminate their target by any means necessary, often rewarding them with bonus money if they manage to do the deed without triggering open conflict.\r\n \r\nHaving obviously received more attention from the developers this time around, with actual NPC dialogue that hints at a simple backstory and reason behind the assassination, and carefully constructed stealth situations, these missions pose a huge improvement from the previous game, wherein players simply had to eliminate a bunch of random NPCs scattered throughout the map. Thus it's clear that with around 30 contracts to choose from, this type of content has never been better since its introduction in \"Assassin's Creed 2\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the design of the main missions often leaves room for criticism as almost every mission happening on land involves tailing segments of one kind or another. Tailing NPCs from a distance needn't be bad if designed properly. However, I can't claim that is the case here. Too often, mission objectives require players to follow NPCs at their pace without getting detected as it causes a reload of the last checkpoint.\r\n\r\nThings become unbearably difficult when those NPCs decide to stroll through restricted areas, as they often do, while players have to simultaneously follow them closely enough to overhear their conversation and avoid the nearby guards. Good luck to those that, in addition to this level of multitasking, try paying attention to interesting dialogue that is transpiring.\r\n\r\nCredit where credit is due, the design of the main assassination missions trumps every previous entry in the series. With around ten main targets for Edward to assassinate in the course of the story, almost all of those missions offer a freedom of approach that was painfully absent previously. Whether you prefer sneaking aboard a guarded galleon undetected, scaling the mast to drop down on your target like a bird of prey or you're the kind of player to go in the true swashbuckling, guns-blazing style, almost anything is possible.\r\n \r\nThe only downside to this is a return of the ever-nagging, optional objectives that proscribe which action to take if you crave that 100% completion. Never the one to like this system that puts a limit on player freedom, optional though it may be, I have to admit that these side objectives are mostly reasonable and have come a long way since they first started harassing players in \"Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood\". One thing to point out, though, is the utterly perplexing prevalence of optional objectives that proscribe air assassinating main targets, not just in this game but in its predecessors as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter the Simulation\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who played previous entries in this series will surely possess certain expectations regarding the audio-visual side of this experience. With every game, come technical improvements and \"Black Flag\" isn't an exception. Those improvements are most noticeable in rainy weather which, with a huge amount of sharp particles and rain-drop effects, is beautifully realized, as well as the general look of the sea, whether it is calm and almost transparent near the shore or it splashes over the deck of the Jackdaw in huge waves as players sail through a hurricane.\r\n\r\nThe art direction is, simply put, mesmerizing. Vibrant colour tones bring to life the still vegetation of the West Indian Islands, in contrast to the various shades of the blue Caribbean. Sailing behind the helm of the Jackdaw, as the crew sings the \"Drunken Sailor\" or any other, well-known, shanty of the time and beyond, is a truly one-of-a-kind experience. This stands in sharp contrast to the gloomy and desaturated atmosphere of the previous game, which, nevertheless, complemented its North American setting.\r\n\r\nIt'd be remiss not to mention the game's captivating soundtrack. While it's true that no game in this series has a bad OST, rarely have I felt that a game's musical compositions accompany its events and elevate the setting to such an extent that it would be an altogether different and worse experience without it. The main theme, heard only in part while perusing the main menu, promises a never-before-experienced adventure once it reaches its conclusion during the game's opening and the rest of the game delivers.\r\n\r\nNearly a decade after it was released, the game is quite stable and has crashed only once in an over-60-hour-long playthrough. Take heed that the PhysX particles setting is unoptimized and will tank the framerate even on contemporary hardware if left at its highest value. Taking it down a notch or disabling it entirely resolves this issue. Also, I can't recall any persistent bugs or other glitches that would have soured my enjoyment of the game.\r\n",

Kitten Squad paints itself as cuddly and approachable -- intended to be played by young people, even -- and once it lures you in it wastes no time aggrandizing the horrors of factory farming and performing animals. In the first, and only, 30 minutes of play I wasted on this game I was exposed to explicit details of animal castration and gruesome depictions of animal suicide. This is something PeTA wants your children to play but it's so shocking that the ESRB had to rate it Teen; I'm surprised it didn't get a Mature rating with the stretches PeTA was willing to make to paint slaughterhouses and circuses as inhumane. This is propaganda, not a game, and it should be treated as such. They pushed this onto the Nintendo Switch for free knowing kids would download it and since it's rated Teen they won't need parental approval. Disgusting.",

          "content": "The RPG system is excellent. You might never become a overpowered god by the end, but you'll notice a difference from being a common peasant, to somewhat semi-competent soldier by the end. A lot of RPG tend to forget that, and it's a nice sense of progression. And that they forged it after The Elder Scrolls games, one of my favorite systems RPG, is no minus either. In fact, The Elder Scrolls could learn a thing or from this system. Also, Bohemia in the 1400s is an excellent setting, and having the game historically accurate without magic or monsters makes this such a refreshing experience contrarily to everything on the marked.\r\n\r\nThe overall graphics are really good. The lighting is atmospheric, the texture work is excellently detailed, and even if my system couldn't run it on max settings on PC, it still looked good. Performance wise it was a bit all over the place, but never unplayable.\r\n\r\nThe voice acting is a mixed bag. The principal cast all almost all well acted, especially Henry, but almost all the side characters lack the same attention. Far from the worst I've heard, but noticeable. Much of the same can be said about the music. It's almost flawless in cut scenes and in big moments, but when exploring or in normal combat it becomes repetitive and unforgettable.\r\n\r\nThe animation, again like the music and voice acting, looks good in per-rendered cutscenes, but outside it's stiff and extremely uncanny valley. The combat is easy to learn, hard to master like any good combat, only here it doesn't seem to always work. It's really clunky, the hit detection is really weird, and way too often feel like it's hold together with duct tape. \r\n\r\nAs I said before, the game still lacks polish. Even though the most outrageous bugs have been fixed, it's still far from finished. Also, the story has absolutely no surprises in store. It's predictable, uses way too many tired cliches. Some of the late game quest are so horrible designed and written it baffled me. Most of the characters are stereotypes of the worst kind, or not fetched out enough. The only two highlights are how you choose to play Henry, which is varied with a lot of options, and a certain priest... who I don't want to spoil for anyone, so I'll just leave it at that.\r\n\r\nThe side quest are for most of the time really lackluster and mindless, missing the simplest depth. Only a handheld of them felt worth doing, others only lead to regret. The games desire to put realism is admirable, but is ultimately to the games detriment. Good game design is \u201cmake it more realistic\u201d, said no one ever. It just makes it even worse when the AI in the game is this dumb, and throws all realism unintentionally out the window. \r\n\r\nWhich brings us to the worst thing about this game: The goddamn saving system. I don't mind a save system like this, but in order to warrant it, your game needs to have a high polish, which the game in many cases doesn't have. The most outrageous example was when I was riding to a town, and my controller suddenly unplugged. The horse kept riding straight into a bandit camp. The horse got spooked, threw me off, and I was stabbed to death by the bandits. Normally I would find this funny, if it wasn't for the two hours of progress lost in the process. The same can be said about many bugged quests, game crashes, or a simple player mistakes like putting all your money into a chest for safekeeping, only to find it deleted and gone forever in the next. This saving system cost me 15000 grochen!!! To warrant a save system like this requires Naughty Dog/From Soft/Rockstar level of quality, something this game doesn't have, and never will. If I hadn't played with a save-anytime mod, I think I would have given up in the first ten hours.\r\n\r\n",

          "content": "I think the best way to describe this game in general is that it put being a game at its highest priority without being shallow. Most of the game is comparable to Nintendo's first-party titles in this respect. \n I may have a lot of negative points on this review, but they are just minor things that I feel never detracted anything significant, but could make it less enjoyable for some. I played without music based on a trailer I saw where they seemingly forgot the music somehow and it was actually really fun. Every area of the game has its distinct ambient sounds and there are also a lot of walking sounds based on the areas. Map design and color schemes are also very powerful. You can read in interviews just how intense the focus on map design and other practical, but hard to dissect, decisions were.\nThe combat system is a dream come true as I always dreamed of designing a similar game that uses a small Tactical RPG battlefield for encounters. And beyond that, the design was very impressive and unusual in that skills do not require any magic points or stamina to cast. Some especially powerful skills are locked behind cooldown that even lasts between encounters, and conditions that may be hard to reach. Also, basic attacks are simply non-existent, but the attacks are enjoyable enough that it does not feel like a pain (like it would have if this was a Mario and Luigi game). Defending against the wide range of attacks in this game also gives this game more depth than your characters themselves offer. There is so much to think about, but unlike many games with deep and complex gameplay potential, you are never worrying about which path to take.\nDifficulty in this game can be pretty easy. If you were to play with \"great\" timing on everything, you can do a lot even without healing items. When it comes to full-manual timing, you are going to have to practice a lot if you want to play efficiently. Also, items can be very powerful, but it is often a trade-off between spending money on equipment or items as the cost of both can be high and you might want to save equipment just to play around with.\nPuzzles can be just difficult enough and they are overall the most satisfying I have played in an RPG. Considering that two of the creator's biggest inspirations were Link's Awakening and Minish Cap and they originally wanted to make this an action RPG, I guess it makes sense they would put a good amount of effort in puzzles. The combat can also be a bit of a puzzle with fitting moves together into situations.\nExploration manages to be fun even with the game's linear nature. You are given one destination at a time, but you are given a lot of space to roam in and there are secrets just about everywhere and areas can leave a lot of room for you to enjoy the scenery and battles.\nStealing is a trait belonging to one character and I wish they gave it to another as this is a very important skill to have in an RPG. The items that you can steal are often amazing, but 90% of them will be obtainable soon and 5% of them attainable later and the other 5% are either rarer drops made more common or completely unique items. If you steal from an enemy you already stole from, you can get a coin, which basically a joke because it will not be a worthwhile coin. The timing of the steal ability can be difficult to do consistently over the course of the game, so if you plan to focus on stealing, you might want to adjust the timing options.\nThe plot of the game is really quite good but it is stretched out over the entire length of the game and some things and characters seem to exist for no dedicated purpose, but I guess that adds to the realism. It is nice that there are still some people in the school despite the condition you find it in. In fact, the interactions with some of these characters are pretty iconic. For some reason, a lot of significant characters become shopkeepers, but it is a fun design regardless.\nIn conclusion, I recommend everyone to try this game. The only reason it seems to be so unknown is because there was not too much marketing on the level that people notice. The game is definitely a case of Kickstarter delivering a very solid game, but the creator is kind of absent from the Internet right now.",

The game starts in a really awkward way where you just wanna mash \"Next\" button because story delivery is atrocious. Add to that several first quests that have you just walking back and forth between few NPCs and you just might want to quit right then and there. But if patience holds, quickly it becomes a fun, vaguely souls-like game. The areas are nicely crafted and if you get over how bad the delivery is, the setting seems interesting.\n\nThis game would score two stars higher if story pulled you in more, NPCs were more interactive and bosses weren't frustrating with add spamming coupled with wallhacks.\n",

This game is balanced for co-op experiences, with many of the bosses utilizing mobs, so everyone is always a part of the action. The main catch of the game is replay ability.  There are 4 main worlds to explore but each of these worlds are randomly generated to some degree. Maps will change, events such as NPCs and even bosses. This means you are likely to miss a load of bosses your first playthrough and even amongst these, there are events which can only occur if you meet more than 1 random criteria. These things may be a turn of to others but for those looking for a game for some of those gaming sessions, this ends up being a great opportunity, having pulled in even those I know who do not play souls-likes but do enjoy some difficulty in games.\n\nI honestly think this is a co-op game that everyone should try. It took just over 10 hours for my first playthrough, however our team is raring to up the difficulty and jump back in. Play on hard for a good starting experience",

          "content": "\ud835\udfd5,\ud835\udfcf/\ud835\udfcf\ud835\udfce\n\"Dry\" review of the dry sequel. I\u2019ll immediately describe a brief conclusion with which I guessed even before the release of the project, this is a continuation for the sake of continuation: Is it better than the first part in terms of plot? - Not. Does she repeat the first part - Yes. Is there anything radically new in the gameplay? On trifles - yes, but this is not enough for a sequel. Has everything become more ambitious and graphically trendy? - It seems to be, but this does not make the game better than the first part, which I consider to be a good budget \"The Last of Us\" for 73/100 with a good concept, a flock of rats chasing you who are afraid of fire, but weak plot dynamics. And now, if you played the first part, and you really liked it, then you don\u2019t even have to listen further, buy Requiem, you will get a new the same portion of the \u201cPlague Tale\u201d.\n\nAnd for everyone else, it will become an average game, created out of a thin air. Okay, what is a Plugue Tale anyway?\nThis is an adventure constantly trying to drive you into tension.. \"Amicia, we were noticed by the guards\", \"Amicia, we were surrounded by rats\", Amicia, again guards, again rats, again danger, again hiding.. And, thanks to a good soundtrack, it works well , but if in the first part, this all happens for the first time, Amicia is not yet very experienced, some intrigue and interest in seeing a flock of rats is still present, then in the sequel these constants \"Oh, they have weapons - need to run\", \"Oh , these also have weapons\", \"Oh, and these can kill us too\", combined with the constant whining of the main character about how everything is constantly bad.. Well, you get so tired of this that you will drop the game 5 times before finishing it.\nIn short, the main gameplay here is - Stealth, yes, you have many ways to kill the enemy, you can choke the enemy by attracting noise, you can distract in different ways, you can eliminate him with a disposable knife, you can put out his torch, and, set rats on him, you can just set rats with the help of some kind of potion or superpower, there are always several paths in the arena, but still, the game design of the arenas and the ai of opponents are quite primitive, the enemies, as usual, are quite blind and deaf, distractions look ridiculous, everything is quite simple and in terms of difficulty, don't be afraid - just look around to understand how the developer thought that the player should go through this section and you will understand everything, although sometimes the game design is lame, because of the enemies standing in your way, and often it is easier for you to somehow go sideways or start a fight before realizing what kind of detour was planned here. Of the differences with the original - just running through the lockation to go to the next section will not work, you shouldn`t have a lot of opponents on your tail, otherwise, an enemy or a stray arrow will catch up with you according to the script, this is done well, but maybe in the first part, this was also the case, I don\u2019t remember, they also added the ability to climb under the tables, again, as in TLOU 2, but it\u2019s easier to walk through blind \"dummies\" with a goose step, I practically didn\u2019t use this innovation. By the way, from comparisons with The Last of US - here you often have to move huge boxes, which Naughty Dog loves to add to their games, and there is a similar story theme of anger and revenge, and how it destroys a person, but it all comes down to conversations.. Well, although a couple of times Amicia really flies off the coils with anger and it creates very cool action-sections, but still, here this topic is used simply for the arch of characters and for linking to the decision of one of the heroes in the finale, \"cyberpsychosis\" at the end we won't get)\nOf course, it`s not necessary to go through everything in stealth, you can start the battle with the help of a \"sling\" - it's something like a slingshot, a stone on a rope, but the resources for this are very limited, although by the end it will be possible to upgrade a crossbow for a supply of arrows more than 1, which can still be pulled back from the enemies later, and then there will be no desire to hide from the boobies at all)\nAlso, \"puzzle\" sections are waiting for you, where all the dark space will be filled with hundreds of rats, you will need to figure out how to light another conditional \"torch\" so that the rats run away and clear the passage for you. There will also be small runner-sections, where you will have to run away according to the script, the simplest \"QTE\" sections, where they give you a minute for each button) Well, also small scripted arenas, where you will have unlimited resources for headshots to enemies.\nWhat did I enjoy anyway? A section with a conditional \"machine gun\", the addition of a crossbow/incendiary resin, swarms of rats have become larger, a couple of moments with them are really spectacular, well .. and that's it, in principle.\nNow let me remind you once again about the minor and not so shortcomings of the game for its fans and critics, who put almost 90/100:\nIt's like nextgen game, but downloads even on ssd are quite long, facial animations are weak, people's bodies are somehow disproportionate, what kind of Bubble head does Amicia have?) Well, at least flocks of rats really got bigger, although not that these pixel lumps are especially worked out in detail. There are more bright moments in the game, but the game's color spectrum is kind of \"gray\" and inexpressive, it's generally unpleasant to look at the picture. The workbench for upgrades is the simplest, you won\u2019t linger on it for more than a couple of seconds, but they also added a system for self-upgrading abilities, depending on the player\u2019s actions - that\u2019s good. Too many resources are given, in stealth moments sometimes it\u2019s even annoying that you deliberately broke through to some kind of chest that will give you some raw materials when you already have full pockets.\nDamn, it's a pity that this is the first story game for which I am writing such a full review, but what can i do, the plot here can be described in one phrase:\n\n\ud83c\udfc6.. Once Amicia directly read my mind during the walktrough, she say something like: \"Again, nothing, well, give us at least something\")) Damn, this perfectly describes how the plot is progressing here, we seem to be going somewhere, but we don\u2019t learn anything, we don\u2019t reveal anything, but the game always promises something, and, like this until the end of the game, with the final - absolutely killing the whole point of 2 games, and I wouldn\u2019t be against such a plot twist if it wasn\u2019t done so banally and stupidly, well, look how other devs did the finale of The Last of Us 1/2, Far Cry 5, here it\u2019s sad not from the finale, but from the fact that they could not have done such a finale and the can come up with a more interesting scenario, and not literally repeating himself in the same game, for example, the same plot moves are repeated with a difference of a couple of hours, \"oh, here again there was trouble and again everyone is bad\", unexpectedly.. One character still saves there the other is exactly the same as they saved him, damn it, how lazy the writers are,\nIn the end, why was this part needed if the first part is an origin-story and therefore is able to keep interest in what is happening much better? In order for Hugo to still learn how to control rats? Well, it\u2019s just an additional option for stealth, that\u2019s all, I don\u2019t consider this superpower directly necessary for the game, the first part was more or less finished, I thought in the second they would at least make an adult Hugo or reveal something else besides a more complete disclosure of the first part`s lore, but, alas.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:

          "content": "I fairly enjoyed the first game, A Plague Tale: Innocence, for its visual design and story, but at the time I also hoped for a more diverse and deep combat system in a possible sequel. Well, A Plague Tale: Requiem surpasses its predecessor not only in terms of combat but in any aspect and to a remarkable extent. The combat system is more refined, finally enabling stealth kills, which were sorely missed in the first game, and implemented in much larger \"arenas\".\n\nSkills progression is based on playstyle, but it's rather convoluted in its implementation, namely, on the number of kills in each encounter, which requires the players to consult a guide to see how many enemies to kill in each encounter to max out everything.\nThe more power of the PS5 also means many many more rats, which in this game have reached a grotesque amount.\n\nOn a more negative point, navigation in open spaces can be quite confusing and in the first few chapters, I find myself stuck at a checkpoint with no option to proceed (that I could see).\n\nBased on rumours and the post-credit scene, it seems that a third iteration of A Plague Tale will happen, so I'm looking forward to that.",

These questions you will try to answer as you delve deep into a strange dreamscape where the only danger is going in with preconceived notions and a fixed point of view.  Enter a world where everything is as it seems\u2026or is it? \n\nSuperliminal is a first-person puzzle/platforming game in a wondrous dreamscape that relies heavily on forced perspective and optical illusions.  Progressing through each section of the dream leads you to more devious puzzles than the last, eventually culminating in a mind-expanding finale.  Picking up items and, using perspective to make them large or small, makes them usable in the world to complete objectives such as reaching a tall place or activating buttons among other things.\n\nThe game has some humor, some wild scenes, and plenty of \u201cah ha!\u201d moments as I finally figured out how to bypass a closed door.  I left each puzzle feeling accomplished for having completed it and eagerly looked forward to the next moment when I could test my newfound skills again.  Additionally, the scenery was well done, if a little stark, and the atmosphere of a dreamy office building was quite enjoyable to explore.\n\nFor those who like to get achievements Superliminal is a great place to get them.  From collecting hidden items, to speed run timers, to the challenge mode\u2014there are plenty of different achievements that can be somewhat tricky to get.  You may find yourself playing the game several times to make sure that you got all the items or just to complete the various trials presented in the Challenge Mode.\n\nAdditionally, there is the Somnasculpt Workshop; a place where you can not only upload 3D objects to place in the game, but you can also make your own level as well.  While the technology isn\u2019t fully realized yet I found it fun running around the workshop and goofing around, uploading an office plant for the Steam Workshop and making my very own level.  I look forward to seeing if the developer will increase the functionality and ease of this mode as it will add another dimension to this already interesting game.\n\nI found Superliminal to be an enjoyable game with plenty to do, puzzles to solve, and a good message at the end.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game for those who like puzzles especially ones that are a bit tricky and require a bit of thinking outside the box to figure out.  I found myself stumped several times but by the end quickly learned how to look at things a bit differently to find a solution.",

The storytelling is very subtle and a lot is left for you to figure out. There are some cool dark vignette type side stories. \nI really liked the look of the game. Not the best pixel art ever but still good with a dark aesthetic that along with the sound desgin created a foreboding mood throughout. \nIt takes about  4 hours or so and isnt challenging gameplay wise so I'd reccomend buying it if you want a short quite minimalist apocolyptic horror story.",

I enjoyed Monster Train a lot, but I reach a plateau where I would have to grind hard to keep enjoying the game. I unlocked several clans, lots of cards, enjoyed the game quite a bit, but in order to really progress and really get better, I would have to spend more time in the game to give myself more time to understand the different strategies to get better and the game. And the game-play is not that enjoyable to me to do that. Still, I can see lots of hours in this if you are willing to think and tinker a lot.",

          "content": "The story is actually pretty decent and the main character is voiced by Anna Akana who is a YouTuber I have been watching for years, so it got me a lot more invested. The story about the whales packed just the right emotional punch and while its nothing mind-blowing, it gets the job done. I have been very stressed in my personal life lately so this game came at the prefect time where I can just vibe and chill. What also helps is this games soundtrack which actually has some great licensed and original tracks. Gameplay wise, its pretty simple, though I did get addicted to scanning all the sea creatures.\r\n\r\nAs for negatives, most of them are minor. For one the story is very short, as I finished it just under 3 hours. Throughout the game you have to scan the sea creatures, and occasionally you have zoom scan them with a drone, which often involves you rotating around them to scan different spots. I can imagine on a controller this is pretty seamless, but on keyboard and mouse, which is what I played on, it felt very janky and unresponsive. I got used to it after a while but it was definitely noticeable. Whenever you go back to visit your submarine, I just noticed how ugly and basic the main characters model looks. The design itself is fine, its mainly just her facial expressions as she just looks dead pan all the time likes she has no emotions, despite the main character (and Anna Akana) being very expressive and charismatic during the diving sequences. Lastly, the game does offer different diving suit skins, which all look very cool but you can only get them after the main story when you unlock free roam mode. You also have to log on every day and do daily dives to earn each skin which is just not for me. It felt like something a live service game would do, and I would have much rather have unlocked some of the skins while playing through the story.",

          "content": "I don't really want to seem so harsh on this game, but it certainly feels like it's trying to say something with it's story, but neither side really connects. Puzzles led to scenes of areas that the characters have been too, but really they just feel more like dolls playing house rather than exploring someone's life. Honestly, it feels like this could have been an entirely different story involving different people with similar beats and no one would be the wiser. Nothing substantial happens with the gameplay, and nothing narrative wise effects it. It's a lot like giving Flower (From Thatgamecompany) a story when that clearly wasn't the point of it. Flower is meant to look pretty, be visually appealing, and be a mellowed out experience. If you give Flower a story outside of it, like a father and daughter bonding, then suddenly it starts to losing a lot of it's magic. That's what Maquette did, it had this really neat visual puzzle game and slapped a story where it shouldn't go. This, of course, isn't getting into the quality of the story either, but I think it's better said that it's plots been done better in lesser time by lesser budgeted games.\n\nMajority of puzzles feel like they can be thought out with guess work, but a number of them feel far too out there for a player to just get. It's not even to a different mechanic either, nearly every single puzzle uses it's ability of size manipulation and movement to get anything done. It's just the way that the game will often require you to use that movement in a way that isn't even introduced to you. It really is an oddity of \"was I just not paying attention\" , and the way the game teaches you what to pay attention to. It's fairly consistent about using items to unlock a path to get between points A, B, and C so you can acquire mcguffin D. Later on however you are consistently asked to start thinking outside the box in order to solve puzzles or pay attention to certain features you usually wouldn't. This by all means doesn't mean all the puzzles are bad, but I did feel often ripped off compared to just saying that was a clever way of doing something. Still for doing exactly one thing for nearly 5 hours, I have to say that the games puzzles start strong and end strong. It may be a consistent trick, but this pony at least exhausted everything it could from it.",

          "content": "- The World -\r\n\r\nWhile being significantly smaller in scale than Darksiders II, the world of Darksiders III feels as empty.\r\nYou can backtrack to find weapon enhancements and hidden loot or fight optional bosses, but none of it really adds anything significant to the gameplay experience.\r\nBar some exceptions, the world itself looks very similar to the one of the first game, hence feels uninspired and dull, not even managing to rekindle some of that Darksiders nostalgia when throwing enemies and environments from previous entries at you.\r\nAt the same time I am glad, that Gunfire Games didn't try to create an illusion of a vast world and stuck with a very linear approach of progression through the levels, allowing you to stray from the path here and there but never far from it.\r\nAlso the absence of sidequests is really healthy for the game, making you focus on the main storyline instead of running pointless errands or finding certain items in boring dungeons to gain irrelevant loot for it like in Darksiders II.\r\nThe few puzzles you encounter are not worth mentioning, because they are easy to solve and add no real value, challenge or fun to the overall experience, which often left me a bit clueless as of why Gunfire Games put puzzles in Darksiders III in the first place, when they tried to reinvent the identity of the franchise anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Visuals and Performance - \r\n\r\nThe game itself looks decent at best and is very inconsistent in the quality of its visuals but never outstanding in any kind of way.\r\nDespite its average looks, the game has multiple technical issues like frame drops, long loading times and tearing.\r\nIt freezes from time to time to load in necessary environment ahead of the player with textures still occasionally popping in out of nowhere.\r\nOnly the very characteristic art direction of the game saves it here and there, leaning heavily towards the great work of Joe Madureira in the first 2 entries but not quite coming close to it in my opinion.\r\nEspecially the regular mobs are forgettable, while most bosses have very fitting and nicely done designs.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Controls -\r\n\r\nThe controls are tight and responsive and are one of the few solid aspects of the gameplay in Darksiders III.\r\nBut they also have to be considering that you get less invulnerability frames dodging on higher difficulties, when it is your primary defensive tool in Darksiders III.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Combat -\r\n\r\nThe problem with the combat trying to take from Souls and Bayonetta is that it does not have one major ingredient vital to Souls' and Bayonetta's combat system, precision.\r\nIn Darksiders III you have huge, but also very inconsistent hitboxes all over the place with enemies jumping or sliding around, covering very wide areas with their attacks, which can get really messy.\r\nThe boss fights is where the combat system can shine, atleast in relation to the rest of the game.\r\nIt works inherently better in 1v1 scenarios than in combat against multiple enemies with its rather slow camera and the very stiff lock on system.\r\nYou have to study and learn the patterns of a boss to effectively combat it and all the main bosses have a very unique and diverse movepool, making every boss fight different from the last one.\r\nThe huge letdown here is, that Gunfire Games decided to copy one of the worst design choices ever from Dark Souls 2 and 3 in my opinion.\r\nYou get conditioned into dodging immediately when fighting small mobs, but more powerful mobs or bosses always telegraph their attack, then delay it to bait your dodge, track your movement and then hit really hard.\r\nI know it was a counter meassure in the Souls games to give players a challenge again who mastered rolling and dodging in the first Dark Souls, but even then it just feels unnatural and tries to force a fake sense of difficulty onto the player. Conditioning someone just to break that conditioning again isn't well done combat design, it is really, really lazy.\r\nThe additional weapons, new abilities and weapon enhancements you can find during the game open up a more versatile way of combat and enable you to approach combat the way you want to and craft your own personal combat style.\r\nThat would have been a nice addition if the combat system itself wasn't so flawed at its core.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Writing -\r\n\r\nDarksiders III probably has the best written characters and dialogue in all three games, especially Fury and her Watcher have nice verbal exchanges and actual personalities, with Fury also having a maybe a bit rushed but nice character arc.\r\nThough one must not overlook some really, really corny or even cringeworthy oneliners or dialogue lines, particularly between bosses and Fury herself.\r\nThe voice acting itself is a bit lackluster as well.\r\nEven the very same voice actors go from well done voice acting to completely overacting their lines, which falls in line with the rest of the game being inconsistent in most other aspects too.\r\nThe story is alright, decently paced and has a really hype cliffhanger at the end.\r\n",

          "content": "[May 2024, 53hrs] I'm a farming sim gurlie, a cozy game enthusiast. I was born in Mineral Town, raised in Leaf Valley. I did the niche games like Innocent Life, the other mainstream ones like Rune Factory. If you can plant crops, raise animals, and marry bachelors, I've probably already played it. Yes, even the post-divorce Natsume ones like Light of Hope and One World.\n\nUnlike those other farming games, Winds of Anthos shifts the focus to exploring the vast, vast world of Anthos and away from actual farming and animal husbandry. The premise makes for an interesting story that isn't original by any means, but it does give your farmer a reason to explore the world. The game tries to twist it up every so often, but there's only so many fetch quests and getting lost in a darkened map one can take before it gets pretty old. \n\nFor me, that point was after finishing the main game up until the winter town of Zimagrad. At that point, I'd opened up Google one too many times for the game to be any fun. I'd run around and backtracked enough and the towns had unlocked too late in the game for me to be doing my favorite activity in any farming game, wooing and marrying the most eligible bachelor around. I'd gotten lost in the volcano too much, and the game had stopped being fun, so I just stopped playing.\n\nOverall, this is still a step in the right direction for this series and it's evident how the game took cues from feedback from the earlier game. Hopefully, they improve on the formula and make the next game even better.",

          "content": "Ori and the Blind Forest really surprised me. I've been seeing it in the Xbox Store for awhile now and thought it'd be a boring indie game that I'd give up on after an hour or so. Only reason I even played it was because it was added to Game Pass. By the end of the introduction I loved it. It was emotional and left me in shock and awe, and I did tear up a little....AT THE INTRO!!! I've been playing it for a couple weeks now, and I just beat the game. The ending not only had be tear up, but literally shed tears!! Obviously not going to spoil what happens, but I was not expecting what happens.\n\nI'm sitting here trying to describe the game and what I love about it, but there's just so much there to write about. There's literally an hour between the last paragraph and this one, because I'm struggling to put into words my thoughts on this game. The gameplay is amazing, the music is powerful (and the soundtrack is on Spotify), and the exploration is one of the best Metroidvania-style games since Super Metroid. You progressively get upgrades so the game is constantly getting more and more interesting. Every upgrade I got made me excited, as it meant more areas I could access and things I could do.\n\nI'm really excited about Ori and the Will of the Wisps, and am upset that there's no definitive release date yet. It just says 2019.\n\nThe only complaint I have with this game is the extreme difficulty during some parts. While most of the game is just the right amount of challenging, there are certain parts of the game which caused me to rage quit for a couple days. It's mostly when completing the main areas, you have to escape the area while being chased by a flood, or lava, or the main villain, or something. However, I would only want those parts' difficulty level lowered slightly. If it was slightly lowered it'd actually feel like an accomplishment when completing those sections. There come a point when you fail an area so much it stops being fun, and completing it is less \"I did it!\" and more \"ABOUT FREAKING TIME!!!\".\n\nAnd for that reason, and that reason only, I'm giving this game a 9 out of 10 instead of a perfect score.",

It really feels like what you would get if you sent a modern computer back to the 90s and told them to make a JRPG with it.\n\nThe art is absolutely beautiful. The entire game looks incredible. It's some of the best pixel art I've ever seen in a game. The sounds and music are also great and really put you in the mood of the game.\n\nThe combat system is simple and fun. It all feels very well-polished. Navigating around the world is also a joy, with lots of rewards for exploring.\n\nThe story is a bit generic at times, but there's a lot of emotional moments and love put into the characters that just makes it work. There's also a lot of parts of the story that are very creative that overshadow the \"generic\" parts.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10",

          "content": "Not to say that Sea of Stars is just a pretty face, but it really does make an impression that ultimately sticks around too long. By the half way point of the game, you kinda seen all you need to see with the game's combat, and there really isn't much new in terms of interacting in battle. Mind the fact that, at least, the majority of attacks and specials feel useful or can be used in a way that doesn't waste the slot, but if you were expecting more innovative learning mechanics (akin to Mario and Luigi) or a cavalcade of spells (like Final Fantasy) this game's combat may start to bore you.\n\nAside from that, I do think the run time for this game is both slightly too long and slightly too short. With the way the game works in a certain twist I feel either the game should have had more in the back end or speed up the pacing in the 1st half. The characters and dialogue for this game are also toned weird with a lot of the side characters acting more personal-able than the main leds, and giving the two main characters too much personality to just be self insert protagonists while also being too stiff. It really isn't so much they are bad, but rather it feels like these protags were picked out in the '90s, and were unaltered compared to the rest of cast. Top that off with some oddball moments of the game feeling like it has more to say without really saying it, and sometimes Sea of Stars can really make you feel like it's a little raw in some parts.",

          "content": "Shantae and the Seven Sirens is, overall, pretty great. The mechanics (and upgrades) are fun, and the levels are good. It\u2019s a full Metroidvania, so it\u2019s all one inter-connected map that gradually opens up, as you gain new upgrades that allow you to reach previously inaccessible areas. There is also a fast travel system, where you can jump between 8 specific screens spread across the map. It does take too long time to load when you move between the divided subsections, but it didn\u2019t bother me too much.\n\nThere are five type of upgrades. You buy special attack items (which I never intentionally used the whole game, just like the past two Shantae games) that use Magic power, and also a couple passive items (use less Magic, attract gems toward you, etc). And then during the story, you gain both transformation/movement abilities, and then some special abilities that use magic power. The final, intriguing power ups are Monster Cards - every time you defeat a monster, there\u2019s a chance it\u2019ll drop its card. Each monster card has a specific ability (specific attack type does more damage, dash faster, Magic regenerates over time, etc), and you can equip up to 3 at a time. The RNG aspect was annoying, though, as there\u2019s no guarantee a monster will drop a card, even if I kept exiting/reentering a screen for several minutes to kill a specific enemy. Thankfully the cards I wanted came pretty quickly, and I quickly gave up on trying to 100%.\n\nMoney is plentiful (almost too much, I was able to relatively quickly buy all items from all stores, and spent a large portion of the game at the 999 max).\n\nMy biggest problem was knowing where I was supposed to go next; partially this was due to playing over the course of several days while being very sleep deprived, so the next day when I started I couldn\u2019t remember where I was supposed to go, and there usually wasn\u2019t an easy way to reference. I resorted to looking up a guide to refresh my memory. But even sometimes in the same play session it wasn\u2019t clear where the next goal was. This usually isn\u2019t a problem for me in Metroidvanias, but it really was this time.\n\nAlso, it lacks some quality of life features many others in the genre have, like some way to track what hidden items you\u2019ve located, much less in a specific area (the only concession is the three heart squids in each Labyrinth, but the only way to see that is when you are actually inside the Labyrinth).\n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed it (I technically haven\u2019t finished yet, but I am saved directly before the final boss). I still think Pirate\u2019s Curse is the best of the three Shantae games I\u2019ve played. I\u2019m torn between this and Half Genie Hero for number two, though; I need to go back and play the post-release content for HGH to make a final decision.",

While the visuals are simplistic, they perfectly match the game's tone, and the writing is top-notch. It's a short but memorable experience that'll stick with you long after the credits roll.",

The military is even more rudimentary though, so nothing interesting there. but the resource management is on par with it's inspiration: number of different resouces is comparable, and logistics are far more advanced. However, at it's current state (at the moment of review), this is also the game's main downfall: while logistics offer robust gaming mechanics, they are also very buggy, so DON'T EVEN TRY to build those fancy railways \u2014 good chances are, you'll simply break a working colony and will have to either replay or spend quite a lot of time with height tool. Also, well, the 'food' mechanics, while pretty standard, have a certain quirk when you thing that your robots are, well, robots. Go ahead and try, it's worth at least that.",

Despite not being perfect and having clear flaws, the game manages to keep itself fresh and hugely entertaining, with its fluid gameplay and vast amount of exploration. The combat feels surprisingly fresh and satisfying to pull off, especially when compared to past Sonic games, and keeps you on your toes while you perform all kinds of cool attacks. The cyberspace levels, while the controls can feel incredibly clunky at times, are generally a fun distraction from the overworld. The real highlights of the game are the boss battles, as the action becomes high-octane in an instant and the heavy metal music begins to blast. Even with those epic songs aside, the rest of the soundtrack is remarkable, being peaceful in the open world and exhilarating within the cyberspace. Overall, even with its flaws, Sonic Frontiers is the most fun Sonic game in decades.",

In fact, the game is extremely simple in mechanics, in combat - 1-button beat `emup with dodges, in terms of tasks it`s bring-give-move those letters and replace them with others, puzzles are more boring than in \"Lego\" games I'm not kidding,\r\nWell, look at 2D it's a regular indie quest, just on a 3D background, you don't even really notice it, yes, I understand that everything is hand-drawn, \"the work was done\" nice job, but are there really not enough cartoon games by 2024.. Why should \"cuteness\" compensate for the completely unoriginal and unmemorable character designs and the rest for me,\r\nAnd 3D dimension isn`t some kind of jumps in different realities, We always get out of the book on the same table, not particularly detailed, the standard unreal engine that everyone is sick of, With a little (very little) platforming and the stuffy simplest stealth from bugs,\r\nAs the game progresses, the path will open up on the table further and higher, it will have cool micro-moments with a quick transition from one reality to another and influence on each other, there will be drawn mini-games like boxing, but all the most interesting is closer to the end, including only one boss who dynamically uses the concept of jumping back and forth,\r\nWell, we can turn the pages of a book to jump into another 2D scene, to find some stupid object that needs to be transferred back to that scene, we turn scene-page fourth and back, and what's surprising about that? Sorry, I don't understand, for me neither the 3D nor the 2D world stands out in any way.. There's only an interesting mechanic at the end, when by turning the book over, also objects in the 2D world start moving,\r\nThis is hardly a Zelda or a Mario for the European market, because everyone praises the gameplay in them, but here absolutely all the mechanics are primitive, they also repeat themselves constantly,\r\nAnd the presence of voice acting in all languages \u200b\u200bis explained by the plot, aimed exclusively at a children's audience, well, like an interactive fairy tale, And even after breaking the 4th wall it doesn't become more interesting, I watched the ending on YouTube and I feel more sorry for the villain here.. Judge for yourself: He realizes that he is a villain in a story drawn by someone, and doesn`t want to constantly lose and be a second-rate picture, why should I hate him? Wtf \"The Plucky Squire\" is a real evil here, who should have united with him and broken these f**** shackles) So that none of the characters would be oppressed,\r\n\r\np.s.

You can perhaps still argue about the mouse and keyboard controls, but if such an Xbox controller has a dozen buttons - why the hell don't you assign them? A for lift, A hold down for fasten? I don't understand how they even came up with this implementation of the controls - and the constant automatic resetting of the camera position is no less annoying. None of this is configurable.\nSoon, the control via touchscreen will come as an update, at which point I hope for a positive surprise. With controls that are as great as in 'Tiny Lands', I would think about 8/10 here. So the frustration eats away at the eye candy. On top of that, the level design is also very nice, but just not gripping.\nThis one is okay, but the gameplay experience just doesn't keep up with puzzle games on the market in the 2020s.",

But it's still however satisfying. even the shortest run will still lead to some learning and unlocks. and even after playing almost 100hrs by now, i still find myself amazed at discovering new mechanics and events. \r\n\r\nThe feeling of getting stronger and building your run is perfectly nailed down. Getting that right spec weapon to sinergise with your primary is just great. \r\n\r\nAnother fantastic thing is the support it received. Not just via multiple quality DLCs, but just a ton of patches and free updates. How can one not mention the Everyone is Here updates adding the ultimate gaming crosover from all the indie darlings. Hollow Knight, Guacamelee, risk of rain..? it just puts a smile on your face each time you unlock one of those :) ",

This game is definitely within the same realm as some walking-simulators, but it grabbed my attention a little better than most. It has some more elements of game play to it than just walking around, but for the most part, you're just enjoying the story, and the melancholy atmosphere. \n\nThis game hits a little close to home. It captures the feeling of someone in their 20s very well. Have/haven't gone to college, dropped out/finished college, etc. It's just mainly about what your life direction is, which is a very big topic for someone in that age range. \n\nOutside of that, the game is very simple, it doesn't do a ton to stand out other than having a good art style, music, and story. I'd say the one section where it's lacking is probably game play. I never felt bored, but I did feel like a lot of the gamey elements were shallow, and just there as a simple deviation from the monotonous walking and talking. (Which actually worked pretty well, as shallow as they were). \n\nIf anything, this is an 8 to 9 hour experience that I'd recommend to anyone who is in their 20s, and doesn't want something mechanically challenging. It's a nice, sit back and enjoy the story type of game.",

          "content": "After the brutal death of her parents, Fran Bow is committed to a mental asylum where things are a little bit crazy.  Determining to escape to find Mr. Midnight, her cat, as well as her way home to her Aunt\u2019s you help Fran in a spectacularly dark adventure where horrors await every turn, madness creeps up on you, and the strange and macabre world of Fran Bow is on full display.\n\nFran Bow is a point and click adventure game where you collect items, talk to various interesting characters and work towards finding not only your precious kitty Mr. Midnight but also at escaping the mental hospital and finding your way home.  Along the way you will experience horror, humor, and the morbid as you help Fran navigate the strange and deadly world around her.  The controls are easy, the puzzles can be somewhat esoteric but can be completed, and the game\u2019s length seems just about right.  Additionally, there is a mechanic involving pills that switch you between worlds and is used to help solve various puzzles in the game.  All in all, a very well-done game and one that will stick with me for quite a while.\n\nAt times I felt like I was a child navigating the world and other times I felt like I was reading a crazy person\u2019s manifesto.  The story has a great mix of childlike naivete and bizarre world building both in equal and mesmerizing portions.  Couple this with strange and horrific artwork in a simplistic style and you have a game that is fun to play as you delve deeper into madness and insanity.\n\nThere are multiple achievements in Fran Bow and most of them, while obscure, are easy to complete.  Some require specific responses in the dialogue while others just require you to complete mini games but all in all a good mix of different types of achievements.  You may have to do a couple of playthroughs to complete them all although this is not needed\u2014all the achievements can be completed in one playthrough.\n\nI enjoyed the quirky horror of Fran Bow as well as the story and the cute art style of the game.  Though a bit slow at points I found Fran Bow to be a fun experience and a worthwhile game.  Fran Bow is best for people that enjoy point and click games, horror game devotees, or those looking for something a bit easier after playing a hard game.  So grab you meds and take a journey with Fran Bow and prepare for some morbid madness.",

It has everything you'd expect from the genre, as well as a refreshingly contained world and accompanying playtime. Still, it falls short of similar greats. TOW quickly becomes too easy, and with such brief combat, there is little need to worry about ammo, consumables, or the entire Tactical Time Dilation system. The game invites linear play patterns that don't particularly encourage exploration. Story-developing text is plentiful but rather repetitive. Inventory management is a major hassle, at least with a controller; there are a handful of incredibly annoying quirks about the inventory menus that led me to dread another venture into reassignment of weapons and armor. And the game comes to an end rather abruptly, sealing the deal on my feeling that the whole experience was altogether somewhat perfunctory. It's worth a play, but I'm not surprised it failed to find the same fervent audience as Fallout, Borderlands, or Mass Effect.",

All the freedom of choice advertised, that you can be whatever you wish is great, if you know what to do with it. Unfortunately in my 15-18hr playthrough (i didn't finish it) that lead me to just being a nobody, not really knowing what i was doing, why i was there, what were those items i was constantly picking up... i just felt like an empty fell is a colourful sandbox world. \r\n\r\nI've had the same feeling for the similar Elder Scrolls and Fallout games, it feels empty to me, i must not be getting something :/ The quest system and choice was one of the highest praised points, but it still feels like an illusion of choice to me since i by default with a gaming mind i will always end up picking up the quest an NPC gives out, the potential reward of loot &amp; XP is always greater than the so called role play. Sure you could kill them, but that's more trouble than not. There's a big concept of fear of missing out when it comes to RPG quests, and i feel Outer Worlds has that.\r\n\r\nI was really interested in the world itself, the not-so futuristic caricature of a corporate humanity was clever and new. It managed to deliver something pretty fresh compared to the standard tropes. Kudos for originality!\r\n",

          "content": "- WARNING: I explain in detail about a certain characteristic of the story that is pretty famous already. It's not tecnically a spoiler, but you can foreshadow easily what will happen if you read this. Read at your own risk!\r\n\r\nThe Walking Dead is a point and click adventure where you have to solve puzzles and make decisions, that Telltale claims that will affect future events of the story.\r\n\r\nAnd as a story (the main point of this game), the narrative is excellent.\r\nThe characters feel real. They have some out-of-character moments, but you'll feel pitty of the good guys and want to kill the assholes as soon as the option pops out.\r\nIt is really long, as well. For this kind of games, that is (arround 10 hours beating the main story).\r\nThe situations that will present in front of you are the point-and-click type. Click things, observe stuff, pick objects, use it to solve things. You know, since the rest of the crowd you hang with apparently are cluless. But it's not that bad. That's classic point-and-click stuff afterall. Good references.\r\n\r\nThis game has all the ingredients to be a masterpiece. Well, it can't be in other way: we are talking about an indie that came out the same year as Journey and still got many attention.\r\nI would give it a 10/10. 25/3 for the ending.\r\n\r\nBut it isn't. And you know why?\r\n\r\nThis game LIES. It's the biggest liar I saw in a while. More than AAAs. More than [insert not-trusty person here that you don't like]. And I can't pass that.\r\n\r\nI can pass that this game has a little of \"game\" and more than interactive movie. I can pass that they used a franchise about shooting zombies and there isn't any zombie shooting. In fact, I appreciate that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I can't pass a game that tells me \"all your decisions will affect the story\" and does EVERYTHING IT CAN to ignore your decisions. No matter how decesive a decision looks: by the next episode (or sooner), you'll see that had no relevance to the plot. And if it did, it will be nullfilled very soon.\r\nAnd this dulls the game. It dulls the game, because the story you'll read is basically the same no matter what you do. They dull the characters the game puts so much effort to build up, because they will do certain scripted things, no matter if you befriended them or treat them horrible. Sometimes they will act different... but that's because this decision is not crucial to advance the plot. To advance it to the ending the creators had in mind. A good one, but the only one.\r\n\r\nThat's why I had to quit it so much points. It's not that the story or the ending is bad. They are good. But they didn't let me decide if I liked more the other \"options\". Despite they told me I would. Too much wasted potential to deserve the perfect score.",

Explore the depths of a pre-human civilization, solve ancient puzzles, flee from horrors beyond human understanding, and manage to hold onto your sanity.  Unspeakable and sinister wonders await in Conarium.\n\nThe visual world of Conarium is amazing.  It is a spectacular and beautiful look at a Lovecraftian universe brought to life for players to enjoy\u2014from monolithic statues to detailed mosaics\u2014there is obviously a lot of time and effort put into the world.  When added with the soundtrack, parts which still haunt me long after I finished the game, what you have is a spectacular walking simulator game where you are encouraged to explore the horrific vistas and things that man was not meant to see.\n\nThe puzzles are not too difficult and are interesting.  However, the number of puzzles is sadly small, and I would have enjoyed more to figure out.  Additionally, I ran into a bug for two of the achievements and with the age of this game I doubt that it will be fixed.  With that being said, I did enjoy my time playing Conarium and managed to keep my sanity\u2026for the most part.\n\nIf you are a Lovecraft fan, I recommend Conarium wholeheartedly.  However, if you do not enjoy walking simulators or if you do not know who H.P. Lovecraft is or think that Lovecraft might be an adult mod for Minecraft\u2026give this game a pass.",

          "content": "STALKER: Call of Pripyat is the third and final instalment in the STALKER trilogy. It is definitively the best one. It has the best gameplay, the best graphics and doesn\u2019t reuse the map like Clear Sky. Technically it is a sequel that takes place after Shadow of Chernobyl, but there isn\u2019t much tying both games together, so Call of Pripyat can stand on its own. Overall, if you want to play just one STALKER game, play this one. \n\nStory \nThe setting is pretty much the same as before, the only exception being that it takes place in a different part of the zone.\nYou play as an army officer sent to the zone to investigate disturbances that have been taking down helicopters that try to make it to the centre. Story has never been a strong point in the series, including this one. It\u2019s enough to provide an objective while playing, and it is engaging, but not much more. \nSide quests are much better here. There is plenty of variety, it isn\u2019t just go here, shoot someone, take something.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nGameplay is at its best here. The only part that\u2019s missing is the faction warfare, but I was never interested in it, so I didn\u2019t mind.\nThe biggest improvement is to the artefact hunting. The mechanics from Clear Sky have been kept and in addition the locations of the anomalies have been enhanced. Now rather than them being just in a random place, it is, for instance, a fire anomaly in an eternally burning village.\nAll other aspect is either similar or better. However, the total playtime you will get out of CoP is less than the previous. \n\nGraphics and artstyle\nGraphics are also at their peak. It\u2019s still outdated, especially compared to today, but it isn\u2019t ugly.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion \nImmersion is also just as good, at times even better. \n\nMusic\nAs I have said before, the soundtrack is practically shared or at the very least similar among the trilogy. It\u2019s mostly dark ambience. My favourite part is \u201cLive to Forget\u201d.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\u201cWe thank you, oh Monolith, may your light shine down on the souls of the brave soldiers who gave their lives in service of your will.\u201d It is now my daily prayer.\n",

Giant Sparrow was the studio developer; they also developed The Unfinished Swan. The director of the game is Ian Dallas, who previously directed The Unfinished Swan. The script was written by Ian Dallas and a team of writers. The game has an original soundtrack composed by Jeff Russo. \n\nIt was developed using the Unreal Engine. The graphics used are highly detailed and visually stunning, and the sound design is impressive, immersing you in a mysterious and dark atmosphere. \n\nIn conclusion, What Remains of Edith Finch is a captivating video game with a unique approach to storytelling and immersive gameplay. Its plot, the evolution of the characters and its bold narrative captivated me as few games have managed to do, and they left a mark that I will never forget. \n\nAnd for that, as well as the incredible art direction and sound editing, What Remains of Edith Finch deserves masterpiece status.",

You cant say anything pretty much offensive whatsoever, and the hypocritical thing about them is they've said the game isnt a children's game, and yet they come out with thirst trap skins quite frequently and you cannot mention anything sexually explicit. Which makes ironically no sense at all, not a childrens, makes thirst traps skins for people to buy skins more and yet nothing sexual explicit can be said. I agree with most of the banning system but as of lately they've changed too much and have become far far too sensitive and hypocritical with a lot of things. And in MOBA gaming communities bad mouthing is what makes it more enjoyable for most people. You take that away and your player base will fall and plummet i promise you that. Even in league they have a better way of doing things where if you continue to do so in game you're muted and no one can communicate with you at all, you cant talk and they cant talk to you or hear what you say.

Some are good because they add dynamism to the games, but others cause you to be eliminated immediately and it is frustrating because it unbalances the gaming experience. When playing with friends you can remove the emotes but the rewards are zero, the idea is that there is an option to pair you with those who do not use it in any game mode that is chosen.\r\n\r\nMany skins are beautiful, they give an extra layer of customization and originality to our characters, plus, with the new update in which they added \"competitive mode with ranks\" it makes us stay a few more minutes playing. Only after a while the same music begins to get tiring, the system chooses the same maps (with variety) and the sad Pay-to-win which is a clear example of how to damage a beautiful video game.",

The gameplay is basically identical apart from the addition of new movement abilities.\nI don't rank Ys Games by their story or characters, but by their gameplay and I still think VIII is the better game. Exploration of the Island was way more fun than the barren samey looking town of Balduq.\nI have some real issues with the combat system that is especially apparent if playing the game on \"Hard\" or above. The bosses seem to be designed around the mechanics of \"Flash move\" and the more powerful \"Flash guard\", which both render you invulnerable for a short time. \"Flash move\" additionally slows the time down, whereas \"Flash guard\" fills your EXTRA meter and makes every attack from you critical. These are triggered by pressing the dodge or skill button respectively just when an attack is about to hit you. These moves can mostly be triggered for each of the enemies attacks and you can even use them while you are attacking yourself. On multi hit attacks you can even trigger them repeatedly and thus extend the duration significantly. These tools are so powerful that they are the best choice in every situation. They are they best offense and defense simultaneously, provided you can time them correctly.\nThe game revolves around flash guard and the spamming your skills. You don't have to learn and react to the attack patterns of the bosses, you just have to use flash guard.",

          "content": "Well, it sure is the end of the Cold Steel sub-series.  Honestly, you already know if you're going to play this game or not.  If you've played the previous Legend of Heroes games -- or at least the previous three Cold Steel games -- of course you're going to play this to see how it ends.  If you haven't played those, please go back and do so before you even look at this game.\n\nCS4 has some of the highest high points of the entire series.  It finishes several major plot threads that have been building up since Trails in the Sky the 3rd and it puts a cap on multiple character arcs, and the ending made me tear up a bit.\n\nIt *also* has some of the lowest lows in the entire series.  The script is incredibly bloated; big scenes are filled with dozens of named characters who are there for no reason other than to include as many characters as possible at the end of the arc, and everybody always has to say something but most of them contribute nothing.  There are several scenes that drone on for &gt;30 minutes that would have taken 5 if the writers just trimmed the fat.  The game's entire second arc is basically just filler that didn't need to happen.  CS4 is 40 hours of plot in a 120 hour game.\n\nIt also dials up the worst tropes from the previous games to the max.  We've got multiple characters whose entire personality is \"sexual assault is funny when a woman does it\", multiple hot springs scenes where the girls all talk about each others' chest sizes, plenty of characters being saved at the last minute by overpowered NPCs suddenly arriving at the scene, and romantic scenes between the main character, his little sister, and his barely-pubescent student.\n\nIf it sounds like I'm being harsh on the game... well, I kinda am.  There is some good content in here, and it's worth playing if you've played through the series up to this point, but there's also a lot of bad content you have to push through, and I hope the next Legend of Heroes series isn't like this.",

          "content": "Luigi's Mansion 3 is a thoroughly enjoyable exploration game. The mechanics overall are pretty well-refined and there's a ton of content contained within.\n\nA lot of what is great about this game comes down to the core mechanic: suck stuff up. It's incredibly satisfying to just clear out a room by sucking up everything in it, grabbing lots of coins along the way. The sounds that accompany this process are great, but the HD Rumble really sets it appart.\n\nThe game has a ton of personality and charm, from the animations of Luigi and friends to the designs of the levels and ghosts. There's plenty of creativity throughout the 17 floors of the hotel, with each boss feeling fairly unique and most floors having a cool theme.\n\nAfter a while though, the gameplay does get quite repetitive. Going from floor to floor and fighting ghosts gets stale after a while, especially considering the length of this game. I still got a lot of enjoyment out of it, but I wish there was a bit more variety. The variety that it does provide lies in the additional mechanics, but these mechanics feel a lot more clunky than the vacuum pack. There were also some level-specific mechanics that weren't really explained/led up to. It was just as though the game expected you to know what to do at all times without giving any visual indications. I imagine some of them would be quite difficult for children to figure out.\n\nThe music is really well done, as well as all of the sounds. Visually, the game looks good, aside from the occassional graphical or physics glitch that can occur.",

          "content": "I'm a late comer to this game but I guess I wound up arriving just in time since there was recently a major update pushed out for this game that in my opinion gives it an even higher score. What The Dub is a party game where players watch a video clip (public domain movies, PSA's, work training videos, etc) where a line of dialog has been edited out. The object is to come up with the funniest line of dialog or \"dub\" to fill in the blank. Players and the audience then vote on their favorite and points are scored accordingly. The game has a tendency to inspire raunchy humor so be sure you're in good company if you choose to bring this one out. The base game comes with several dozen clips however just recently What The Dub was given Steam Workshop access and now you can download clip packs for all sorts of things. This greatly extends the replay value of the game because you're less likely to get repeats that everyone has seen before if you download additional clip packs. Whether you're playing What The Dub locally with a group of friends or streaming it online you're sure to get a lot of laughs and enjoyment out of this game.",

          "content": "16. Project Warlock\n(I didn\u2019t finish this game)\nProject Warlock is a classic FPS similar to Wolfenstein 3D. This means that there is no need to look up or down, as everything will be on one axis. All verticality is purely visual. Although it has some amazing pixel art and satisfying weapons, the lack of differentiation between level design, and its length hold it back. I would recommend it if you simply want to mindlessly shoot at monsters.\nStory\nYou have to kill multiple evils so that you can fight and kill the great evil. This is not a game to play for the story.\nGameplay\nJust like in older games like Wolfenstein 3D, only the x-axis matters. It allows you to look up and down, but it serves no practical function. This also extends to the level design \u2013 you are never above or below enemies, and you never move up or down. Another similarity between Project Warlock and its predecessors is its overreliance on key hunts, which in this game is almost every level. All of this leads to the levels blending in together and becoming forgettable. The weapons are at least an upgrade. There is a wide variety of them and each one can be upgraded to one of two better versions. Don\u2019t expect much interaction between them, and also the only reason you have for using weaker guns is if run out of ammo. There is also magic that you can use to deal extra damage and a level up system in which you can invest points to increase your stats. Enemies have plenty of variety in them, but again no y-axis. Bosses are mostly just bullet sponges.\nGraphics and artstyle\nProject Warlock has amazing pixel art. Everything from the walls to the guns and foes is beautifully illustrated. There is also great particle effect and lighting.\nAtmosphere\nWhatever atmosphere that it tries to build is crushed by its simplicity.\nSoundtrack\nThis game has a 5 HOUR soundtrack. It\u2019s alright.\nFinal Thoughts\nCould be better.\n",

You will start with Axe and Dagger, later you will find Pistol, Shotgun, Dynamite, Crossbow, SMG, Warlock Staff, Minigun and other.\n\nAs you play, you will get upgrade points, which you can use with your weapons.\nYou can turn your .50 Magnum into flare gun, which sets fire to the enemies, Warlock Staff can be enhanced with ice.\n\nYou Warlock also has great magic potential - Storm Rage, Freezing Blast, Holy Guard etc.\n\nBig minus for me - music. It's just feel off.\nIt's doesn't give you that adrenaline and dopamine rush, which you can find in games like Prodeus, Doom and other fast-paced shooter games.\n\nThis game is a good throwback to old FPS games - many weapons, abilities, a little bit of puzzles with a variety of enviroment and monster's choice.",

I haven't seen this properly tested game in eons. It's a puzzle adventure game where no quiz was left without a handy little touch of a hint here and there. Who wouldn't love floating green Pikachu? Even light is helping you on your travels. Those are small details that are making the whole game-level design and puzzle design exquisite.\n\nThe simplistic voxel-like graphic is astonishing. I was losing my breath while visiting different worlds. A smooth grainy lighting system with a very well-crafted atmosphere and fog make this game so sweet you'll want to lick it. Add to that a contrasting light, a fairy light that doesn't lead you astray. \n\nI like how the developer plays with the light of the sun rays, which are very accurately placed in multiple places, so you can't miss them. And they look just beautiful.\n\nThe minimalist tones of the music give the game a dreamy atmosphere, although if you stay in one area observing the world around you for too long, it becomes slightly repetitive.\n\nThe game mechanics are very fresh. Skills make sense and add an interesting depth to the whole game as you grow more skillful. And the map is something you haven't seen yet. I am one of those weird completionist players, so the percentage counter made my life way easier. Other games usually let you sit in the dark.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game is that it was developed with a game controller, and the keyboard controls aren't quite right, especially for the \"long jumps\" this was a bummer.",

          "content": "An interesting game , with a fun art style and world. The game is a roguelike with randomized levels, various power-ups, and final bosses on each stage. The combat can be enjoyable at times, with a variety of weapons and power-ups to choose from; anything in the environment can be weaponized, and there are some interesting pick-ups (cars, giant pencils, etc.) and power-ups. The combat on the whole is third person, and can be janky at times. I found myself taking damage for random things that were outside of my control, and found the tells on enemies and bosses to be present, but uninformative at times. I would say the combat can be fun, but was a negative overall. \n\nThe world itself is uniquely animated and presents an interesting corporate dystopia of start-ups in a megacity, with canned progressivity and bland corporate dystopia - very appealing to this gamer, and a definite plus for the game. The characters in the game are interesting, and feel at times like a little family, with some great dialogue prompts and humour throughout. \n\nThe level design was passable at times, but I felt it was somewhat weak. The randomized levels never feel that random - the same rooms will be present constantly, and are easy to master. Even the progression between levels feels rather similar. New zones will have new weapons with different skin, but for the most part perform in the same way. New enemies may offer slightly different challenges, but again, not enough to feel unique, or really grab my attention.\n\nGoing Under was certainly a net positive experience. It offers good third-person roguelike action, which is somewhat original in the genre. The art style was a definite plus for me, as were the progression systems, the powerups, and the characters and humour of the game. Some downsides are the combat and the actual level progression, which often felt vapid and less than unique. All told, worth a play for fans of roguelikes, and those looking for a lighter experience.  ",

          "content": "Stardew Valley is in the overgeneralizing genre of \u201crelaxing games\u201d. For a lot of people, this is the go to when they think of a relaxing gaming experience, and for good reason. It executes that part flawlessly. There is no rush, no overarching narrative pushing you towards a certain direction, you just take care of the farm and interact with the outside world as you see fit. Personally, I enjoyed my time with the game, although I was never taken hold by it as others have. If you just want a relaxing experience, there is hardly a better game for you.\n \nStory\nYour grandfather has recently passed away and left you his farm in Stardew Valley. As the sensible person you are, you decide to resign from your job and go live there together with its roughly 20+ permanent residents. \nThere is no overarching plot. The citizens of Stardew Valley go about their lives, you interfere, whenever you decide. Romance is an option, even marriage, however that's not the case for every NPC.\nThere is also kind of a villain with the Joja Corporation, which is apparently so desperate for new customers that it decided to build an entire supermarket in this tiny community. They disappear if you progress the game enough while also ignoring them.\n\nMechanics and gameplay\nStardew Valley has a variety of things to do, the most obvious being taking care of the farm. Planting, watering and watching them grow is what that consists of. However, as the farm grows the player requires better tools, sprinklers and more to keep up. This can be achieved with money earned from selling crops and going into the mine for materials. \nWhat I described above is what most players will experience at some point while playing Stardew Valley. There is a lot I've left out - fishing, foraging, farm animals and so on. It will be a while before you take part in everything this game has to offer.\n\nGraphics and artstyle\nThe artstyle of Stardew Valley is simplistic 2D pixel art. Describing it as simplistic is however deceiving, there is a lot of care and attention put into everything to make it fit with the rest of the game.\n\nAtmosphere/Immersion  \nStardew Valley reminds me of reading a book in which I know no character will die, no major drama will happen, but I just can't stop reading, because all of those small moments, those insignificant interactions are so well written.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe ost is similar to the rest of the game - calming, cozy. I have no idea how this genre is named, but it's the type of music I would put in a \u201cRelaxing music to listen to while studying/sleeping\u201d playlist. My favourite part is \u201cWinter (The Wind Can Be Still)\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI looked all throughout the map and didn't find a single eight lane highway. My initial belief that this is set in the USA is shaking.\n",

          "content": "##Gameplay: ufff tiene tantos detalles que me dividire en partes para poder cubrir varios de los aspectos que hacen bueno a este gameplay.\r\n\r\n1 La forma de recorrer el mundo: es un juego semilinial, en un punto llegamos a una sala donde hay varias puertas que conducen a varias zonas y podremos decidir por cual ir primero, claro algunas estaran bloqueadas o necesitaremos pasar por una zona antes para desbloquear una cosa en cierta zona, esto hace que nos sintamos con mas libertad e inter\u00e9s ya que el inicio de la historia es algo ambiguo y pesado pero cuando somos soltados aqui se nos da rienda a nuestro sentido de aventura e interes por el mundo e iremos a las zonas que mas nos interesen haciendo que cada uno lo juegue de una manera un poco distinta haciendo que te involucres mas con cada suceso \r\n\r\n2 Los Combates: varios juegos indies rpg que se interesan por contar una buena historia se olvidan de hacer el gameplay divertido, a veces dejando combates por turnos que son simplemente aburridos porque no aportan nada a la historia y no son divertidos de jugar, y este juego no es asi, los combates son un muy buenos incluso si no entiendes nada de la historia solo por estos combates vale la pena jugarlo, viendo netamente el gameplay son como un juego de ritmo deberemos seguir el ritmo de la m\u00fasica o guiarte por tus reflejos para esquivar sucesiones de ataques desde ondas de luz peque\u00f1as que puedes saltar hasta barreras, es simple pero cada combate es diferente porque no hay combates contra enemigos gen\u00e9ricos todos los combates son contra personajes del juego por lo que todos tienen una m\u00fasica distinta y ataques distintos, algunos hacen cosas especiales y todos tienen su estilo distinto y al final tiene sentido porque esa m\u00fasica y estilo en que los ataques vienen hacia ti son parte de la personalidad y esencia del personaje contra el que estas luchando lo que hace que cada personaje se sienta \u00fanico, y no es solo esquivar, en zonas usaremos una espada para reflejar ciertos ataques de un color, algunos enemigos distorsionaran la pantalla, y se da un giro interesante a los combates haciendo que sean parte esencial del gameplay y nos cuenten mucho, un aspecto negativo es que al principio nos saturan mucho con estos y llega a cansar porque no entiendes que pasa pero una vez pasado ese inicio ya este problema no esta y aun asa los combates del principio son interesantes.\r\n\r\n3 La Simpleza, Accesibilidad, Variedad: El juego trae muchos modos de dificultad para que encuentres el que se adapte a ti, esta el modo de dificultad llamado story que hace que seas muy dif\u00edcil de matar si solo te interesa seguir por la historia, y aun as\u00ed en el modo normal todo es sencillo, no super f\u00e1cil a veces querr\u00e1s cambiar de dificultad pero los controles y todos son muy simples y sencillos de dominar, moverte de izquierda y derecha y saltar, solo necesitas reflejos para los combates y curiosidad para explorar, y no solo eso si no que incluye variedad, podr\u00e1s ir a unas carreras, esquivar trampas mortales en un lugar, ciertos puzles o acertijos de ir intercambiando cosas, aunque al inicio son puros combates seguidos despu\u00e9s nos da variedad e cosas por hacer sin volverse algo complejo es simple entendible y accesible lo que hace que cualquiera pueda jugarlo y disfrutarlo \r\n\r\n##Dise\u00f1o e Historia: La manera en la que el juego esta dise\u00f1ado es magnifica, el \u00fanico punto d\u00e9bil es el comienzo como ya dije, pero despu\u00e9s es una maravilla como implementan un mundo tan \u00fanico raro e interesante y a la vez nos cuentan una historia con un buen mensaje de fondo, aunque no se profundice tanto en la historia atravez de las mec\u00e1nicas como lo hizo undertale, este juego nos logra contar una gran historia de una forma memorable, con interacciones puntuales bien puestas, le da una personalidad \u00fanica a todos sus personajes y un dise\u00f1o muy diferente a cada uno no hay ninguno que se parezca todos son \u00fanicos, y no es que sean complejos, tienen personalidades simples, unos son sarc\u00e1sticos, otros discretos, unos muy graciosos, cada uno esta bien caracterizado y hace que empatices bien con ellos, sus batallas nos cuentan como son puedes asociar una canci\u00f3n con ellos, te hacen interactuar de forma org\u00e1nica, no se quedaran en su zona y no se mover\u00e1n de ah\u00ed, puedes encontrarte a algunos en distintas zonas lo que hace que se sienta mas vivo el mundo y sientas que sus personajes realmente son integrantes de everhood que se mueven por el mundo para visitar a sus amigos a jugar un juego de rol, ir al cine o a las carreras. El mapa es muy \u00fanico con sus zonas diferenciadas a las que accedes a trav\u00e9s de puertas las cuales tambi\u00e9n tienen personalidad y te hablan, el punto de guardado siempre te saluda o te dice algo, cada zona con su iluminaci\u00f3n colores estilo y cosas hace que se sienta muy unico recorrer everhood. En cuanto a la historia tiene giros interesantes, te hace empatizar con los personajes de formas sutiles que ya mencione, y hace que puedas llegar a sentirte culpable o aliviado, aunque su mensaje queda un poco al aire por el new game plus pero aun as\u00ed no es algo que estorbe mas bien a\u00f1ade al gameplay y logra contar todo de una manera muy buena, el new game plus solo esta para que veas unas cuantas cosas mas pero  no es algo que cambie la narrativa es solo a\u00f1adir mas horas de gameplay para los que quieran exprimir aun mas este mundo porque sintieron que se dejaron unos detalles atr\u00e1s y cierra las cosas de una buena forma haciendo que al final no sea contradictorio con su mensaje pero al principio lo puede parecer \r\n\r\n\r\n##Apartado Grafico: un 10, de los mejores gr\u00e1ficos que he visto, y no hablo de realismo ni nada, si no que todo esta muy bien hecho, efectos alucinantes en los combates, unos gr\u00e1ficos tan sutiles que da la impresi\u00f3n a veces de recorrer un entorno 3D y porque no entornos y cosas 3D mezcladas con sprites 2D los cuales no desentonan, es un apartado grafico maravilloso con un dise\u00f1o de personajes muy memorables cada uno con sus colores y estilo y con unos efectos tan alucinantes que hacen que los combates sean memorables, no deja nada que desear no hay nada que se sienta feo o que desentone y es una gran propuesta ya que no se limita a un pixel art con iluminaci\u00f3n simple si no que mete efectos y mezcla distintos estilos haciendo que quede maravilloso\r\n\r\n##Soundtrack: espectacular y variado, lo mismo que con los combates y los graficos, le da personalidad a sus personajes y al mundo, tendremos canciones calmadas, chiptune, canciones de metal, mezclas de ambient con otras cosas, una canci\u00f3n diferente para cada combate zona y aunque algunas canciones suenen raras por fuera cuando la vez en el juego se sincronizan perfectamente con los ataques o se acoplan de forma perfecta a la zona nada mas que decir \r\n\r\n ",

          "content": "Everhood was a unique experience for many, myself included. It's an unusual rhythm game with excellent music, gameplay, and story. During some fights, many visuals will begin to change, such as bright background changes and the screen rotating around; this creates the trippy feeling that the game is known for. The music makes the gameplay even more enjoyable, with the enemy's notes lining up with the timing of the song playing. The story isn't very memorable, but it's solid and intriguing. At some points in the story, I was caught off guard and surprised at how the events unfolded. As you explore the world of Everhood, you will meet a large cast of quirky characters who contribute to making this experience an odd but wonderful one. Overall, Everhood is a game that is incredibly different from any other recent game, and its gameplay and weirdness are the reasons why it's so original and worth playing.",

          "content": "Developed by the legendary Yuji Naka, Balan Wonderworld is packed to the gills with hidden features, like a special diffculty if you're playing too well, and bonus trophies for defeating bosses with an unexpected costume.\n\nBut who cares?!\n\nIf Yuji Naka is legendary, then I'm fucking Bigfoot, because some of these oversights are basic and inexcusable. Let's get the obvious out of the way: the issue of jumping is but one problem, and they clearly assumed enough people would play multiplayer to have one poor soul be a dedicated jump-slave. The real issue is the level design and practicality of the disgustingly situational costumes.\n\nWhy have a dragon costume that can't even shoot fireballs very far, followed by a robot costume that shoots lasers a huge distance like 1 chapter later? These are some of the easiest design issues to reason out during the brainstorming phase of your game, but they must have been braindead during that time. All of this was deliberate: Yuji Naka wasn't drunk when he did this, no sir.\n\nHe proudly walked in with a checklist and it said \"3,700 costumes, but one button does everything, and get all that Sonic nostalgia out of your head, because we're only moving at the speed of a real hedgehog now.\" Clearly, we just can't understand his master plan.\n",

          "content": "Balan Wonderworld is a game that has received an unfair, if not cruelly excessive, amount of hyperbole for simply not conforming to what people wanted Balan to be: a sequel or spiritual successor to NiGHTs.\n\nWhen you allow Balan Wonderworld to be Balan Wonderworld and stand on its own merits without comparing it against NiGHTs (because it's not), you have an extremely beautiful, surreal, heart warming, relaxing and simplistic 3d platformer that children and adults of all ages can enjoy. The simple, one button controls (technically two if you can the button used to cycle through the costumes you're carrying), allow for anyone to pick up and play the game with ease. Because of this unique control scheme, Balan Wonderworld is quite possibly the only 3d platformer that I can play enjoyably on my phone with just touch controls and Steam Link.\n\nNegative reviews love to whine about the costume system, but what they don't tell you is that the majority of the costumes offer passive abilities in order to not interfere with the player's movement, such as auto-firing projectiles, enhancing mobility with ground pounds, hovering, wall climbing, multi-jumps, flight; or even stopping time! The few costumes that do replace the player's ability to jump with something else is easily addressed by the fact that the player can cycle through the three most recent costumes they acquired, with the oldest being sent safely to the player's dressing room storage (accessible from any checkpoint) upon acquiring a fourth.\n\nAnother common complaint the game gets is the fact that later costumes make earlier ones obsolete. While this is true, it is by far nowhere near a game breaking experience. In fact, there's nothing wrong with this because that's how progression works in some games. Of course the late game stuff is going to be better than the early game stuff! It is completely asinine to expect otherwise. That's like calling Super Mario Bros. 3 a bad game because the Tanooki Suit makes the Super Leaf obsolete, or the Hammer Bros. Suit making Fire Flowers obsolete. Or Curaga in Final Fantasy making Cure and Cura obsolete. Or Ultima making practically all offensive magic in Final Fantasy obsolete. The list goes on.\n\nWith the elephant in the room addressed, the other thing that makes Balan Wonderworld a wonderful experience is the sheer amount of content you get. The game is LOADED with secrets and extras, and the game rewards exploration in a way more satisfying than the majority of games I've ever played. There's areas I thought would be out of bounds and instead I was rewarded with anything from gems, a Tim egg, a hidden costume, or even a Balan Statue. It never ceased to amaze me how many areas I thought were \"cheese\" or \"out of bounds\" only to find out that the stage designers left something waiting for me there as a pat on the back and a \"I see what you did there.\" Collect all the Balan Statues hidden in a Chapter and you're treated to the English lyrics of the song and dance routine that plays after beating that Chapter's boss.\n\nAnother neat thing about Balan Wonderworld is the difficulty adjusts itself automatically based on your playstyle. If you like fighting enemies and are exceptionally good at not taking damage, the game will start giving you more and harder enemies. If you tend to avoid combat or take damage too often, the game will reduce the amount of enemies that spawn and replace them with weaker, easier enemies. The same applies to even bosses, who have a unique Hard Mode variant. My only complaint about this system is it's overly cautious about not making the game too hard, and will instantly dial back the difficulty from Hard to Normal upon making a single mistake, while scaling the difficulty back to Hard requires a considerable grind (requiring the player to defeat about 10+ whole waves of enemies without taking any damage or falling off the stage). Overall, at the game feels about as difficult as your average Kirby game, which is to say that difficulty is practically nonexistent outside of Hard Mode, and that's okay because if you came to Balan's Wonderworld for difficulty, you came to the wrong place. This game is about having fun exploring and experimenting.\n\nSpeaking of exploration, the game does a spectacular job hiding collectible both in and out of plain sight. In fact, some are so amazingly well hidden that the game thankfully provides a costume with x-ray vision in one of the late game chapters. It also rewards experimentation by awarding bonus statues for finding certain unique ways to damage bosses.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about Balan Wonderworld, is that when playing multiplayer, some costumes are exclusive to Player 1.\n\nOverall, if you want to have a fun, relaxing, feel good time, visit Balan's Wonderworld. As someone who 100%'d the game and got every Achievement, trust me when I say you won't regret it.",

It truly paints out a surprisingly large alien world, and with some very interesting secrets to discover.\n\nA nice addition as well, is how the low-heath beeping goes in time with the music, and isn't just overwhelming like most other games often would be.\n\nAnother fun point is how quite a bit of lore is found through exploration, rather than everything being handed to you. It appeals greatly to my love for discovering things, and makes it that much more intriguing to me.\n\nHighly recommend especially for those who've played Hollow Knight and are looking for something that'll give a similar feeling of exploration.",

With Rough Justice we jump into the year 1984 and as an ex-con we have to help our good friend who is in trouble with his detective agency. With well thought out mini-games, agent micromanagement, leveling and a touch of DnD we uncover step by step all sorts of underworld machinations. The story dialogs are lovingly dubbed and the entire gameplay is accompanied by 80's music. \n\nRough Justice is also something for the eye and for bookworms. The lovingly designed art style of the 80's lets young and older ;) indulge in nostalgia while the very well elaborated biographies of the individual detectives fit harmoniously into the scenario. \n\nAn absolute MUST for every nostalgic and those who have a love for detective stories!\n\n",

You have the management system in place as you control the tasks that are completed by your hired agents, you have the puzzle elements that you solve as you choose a different case worker to work for and then you have the board game element with the dice rolling. RNG runs this game and you can add to the dice being rolled with gear that helps you to stand a better chance of succeeding. I played the demo of this and enjoyed it then, I have since played the full release and the storyline is interesting and the gameplay is incredibly user friendly with the tutorials to hand. I recommend this if you enjoy 80s nostalgia, time management, dice rolling and the hopes that this will also be developed into a board game.",

However, as soon as you get past the first few twists, the game gets extremely rewarding.\r\n\r\nThis game ends up having a simple but fun RPG setup that is really serviceable for what the game is, a great puzzle system that sometimes feels annoying but is overall extremely rewarding in drip feeding you information that helps you connect the dots really well, and characters which were honestly fairly deep while still maintaining a somewhat childlike atmosphere, balancing drama, trauma, and sugary wholesomeness really well.\r\n\r\nA really good game, this one, especially for people who really like old-school RPG maker games.

We immediately get the sense that something is off through the way information is presented in the journal; sometimes words might be scribbled out, or written over. The player is provided an eraser to uncover some of these additional details, it's a really nice way to help us delve into Kasio's thought process; we can see the way she constantly second guesses herself from moment to moment.\n\nWith each new scene, we're getting a fuller, more comprehensive persepective of her situation; of all of these people and thoughts that weigh so heavily on her psyche. The journal Kasio has entrusted to us holds her innermost secrets and desires, and the journey we take with her is one that feels both intensely intimate, and emotionally sincere.\n\nThough the gameplay in If Found... never really evolves, and admittedly might have grown stale in a longer game, its tremendous visual/aural presentation is enough to keep things consistently engaging throughout the course of its relatively brief 2.5 hour runtime.\n\nEven in 2021, media featuring queer characters are still few and far between, and even more rarely do they feel quite as authentic and fully realized as they do here. While it might not break new ground in terms of its gameplay, it's still a powerful, and often brutally honest representation of the trans experience, and a must play for anyone aching for a great story. An unforgettable and incredibly moving visual novel. \n\n8.5/10",

If you, like me, were waiting for a full version for the sake of story missions and the final point, then, unfortunately, the authors realised this aspect of the game as tritely as possible, yes, there is an interesting scientific lore, there are a couple of interesting and other \"ctrl + v \" laboratories of micro-world, there are a couple of 10-second cutscenes-dreams, but in fact there is no plot here, look what the game is about in general:\nwe are 4 children, somehow reduced to the size of an ant, we begin to eat insects, knit armor from them, along the way finding a laboratory that surprisingly matches our size, inside we meet \"Burgle\" - a robot who agrees to help us return to our \"big\" world, it begins to give us all sorts of tasks, like go there, find me some kind of chip there or turn on something. In the notes we read about the experience of a doctor who was left without a family, in key places - we met bosses like spiders - \"Black Widow\" for ex., And in the end, well, it's ridiculous to call it a spoiler, we just increase to a normal size.. and that's it, Yes, we will meet a couple of characters , there will be a final purely gameplay battle, and this is the whole plot.. We just collecting the necessary things, exploring key places, \"blah blah blah\" in notes / dialogues, and at the end we kind of \"grow up\", although they won't even show you the cutscene of it, it will be just a 2D clipping from a future newspaper, why and who made these laboratories - this is all described as banal as possible, mad scientist +a thirst for money of no-name company..\nI am disappointed, compare with the same \"Raft\", where each story location had a different setting, provided new gameplay mechanics, even there the missions could be called really \"story-driven\", not just running around the laboratory in the forest, then lab under water.. then in a cave, and even the story bosses are not \"surrounded\" by any game design, it's always just a big open location where you have to peck the boss, bypassing him from all sides, because usually the enemies here are hardly fixated on only one person.\nUndoubtedly, Grounded by Microsoft Studios has a huge budget, incredible Unreal Engine graphics (Although the optimization for the release is generally dead), good animations, it feels like this is not just another indie-survival, but a really high-quality product, but creativity, \"soul\", like in Raft, there is much less.\n\nMaybe then the authors worked more on the open world and its research? Well, things really are much better here, the scale of the open world is amazing, it will take tens of hours for full explore, if you also try to find all the secrets that are also well done, again more to the budget - physics.. some sorts of lumps floating under water, or, a drop of dew or spilled soda rolling down the mountain - give the world even more quality and believability.\nAnd, of course, in general - the game gives a unique opportunity to feel very small in our world, climb on ordinary human objects that are so huge from the perspective of an insects, roam through ant caves or get caught in the net of an ordinary, but such a big and scary spider,\nAnd, by the way, about this, about the dangers and the combat system, which is the second main flaw of the project, which, for me, prevented Grounded from gaining more popularity, despite the huge love of players for this genre, the point is that you are constantly..at every step..just CONSTANTLY TEARED..sorry, but I just don\u2019t know how else to say, walk a couple of meters - an ant will attack you, walk another - a wolf spider will beat you, run away from them - in the next location be ready for bites of mosquitoes, bees, all kinds of caterpillars, ladybugs, small, but mad ticks..\nMany players, for example, don`t like survival games, like me, by the way, simply because you have to farm incredibly a lot, but in Grounded, add on to this point that you are attacked at almost every turn, if you will attack in response - either you you will suffer, because after 1 enemy, his flock will run into you, or you will suffer - because your weapons and armor, by the way, are also completely worthless even for the weakest opponents, only by the end of the game, after about 50 hours, having a weapon of level 3, only then will you be able to feel on a par with the current inhabitants in terms of strength, before that you will act a lot according to the \"Faster feet - not afraid of hits\", because of which your HP will constantly be at zero, very simple lifehack - die, respawn, and run to your backpack, this is not a \"Raft\", where if you died on the island, your body will have to be dragged to the base.\nSuch a system of incredibly aggressive mobs that spawn in every square centimeter of the map makes the game incredibly hardcore and not very comfortable for a relaxed grind if that's what you're after. Yes, but there are many different weapons, as well as many interesting recipes, visually interesting - armor for ex., some kind of hat made from the eyes of a spider or tick fur, in general, there are no problems with crafting in the game, learning new things is interesting, a normal upgrading system, but not for the abilities, it seems to me that it doesn`t work at all. What is another huge plus for creative people - (although, of course, I have no idea how many millions of years it takes to farm), but judging by the screenshots of other players, the game setting allows you to build incredible cool castles from leaves / mushrooms and other improvised means.\n\n\ud83c\udfc6 In general, once again, I summarize, Grounded - is beautiful and perfect in small things, with a well-designed setting, but constantly annoying in its main gameplay, and, careless attitude to the story, and, by the way, to the final location, which also opened just in the full version.. the last part of the map, next to the shed, turned out to be a boring \"not stand out\" stretching the game for another 10-20 hours, despite the fact that the game is already mastered with all the quests, for 60 hours.\np.s. Now we are waiting for \"Forest 2\" in February?)\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\n///\n\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438

          "content": "The game  came out with many divisive topics, but I wanted to give it a good chance. Overall though, as of now this sits as one of my least favorite mainline games.  Combining the worst elements of the last two generations, and adding a couple more I disagree with.\n\nTo discuss, the graphics, they aren't up to the standard provided by the Switch's first party library, I am unsure if there were bugs but everything looks incredibly fuzzy on console whenever I attempted to play docked, as if the resolution had not been changed, this is without discussing the lackluster wild area.\n\nIn terms of gameplay. there were many changes that I wasn't happy with. Although probably in the minority. Random battles were never exciting since every battle was intentionally entered or a nuisance. This meant I ran from almost every battle not encompassing a new pokemon to catch. Because of this change, I also felt like routes were less exciting, which may coinside with the shorter amount in the game overall. Since I never found it necessary to train all my pokemon equally thanks to the always-on exp share, I actually found myself caring less about my pokemon, and sticking to a couple of power houses for anything but type advantages. Even playing this way, I never found myself in dire shape. \n\nAlthough the story felt just as stop and start as pokemon sun and moon, there were some interesting ideas presented with the gym leaders, and the last area. Although in the end the game diminished these by making these points extremely easy. \n\nWhat I can say is the the music is great as always, and even if you do skip this game. I do suggest giving it a listen.\n\nHonestly, I can't give the game a strong recommendation as it doesn't excel in anything the series is known for. You would do better to go back and try an older game and get a probable better experience. On the other hand, you would not get the zeitgeist and buzz of playing the game with others.",

I can't say whether I enjoy or I don't the quality of life improvements (such as sharing experience points from the start), as it adds and takes away from the game equally. Pokemon Shield heavily focuses on the wild area, not the story (the pacing is so off), the world somehow seems a bit small, and it doesn't have a full PokeDex. Despite all this, the entry seems fresh, and feels like an evolution. The Pokemon series is never going to go back to the HeartGold/FireRed, and if this is what we are getting going forward, I can live with it.",

This game is so shallow and boring that it eventually becomes nauseating.\n\nThe most annoying thing is the main plot and the lore of the world. To put it briefly: it's a clich\u00e9 stacked upon a clich\u00e9 upon another clich\u00e9. Seriously, the main characters, the plot, and the story of the world are the epitome of the word \"clich\u00e9\". You can predict what is going to happen after the first 30 minutes of the game\u2014it is so shallow and typical that it eventually makes you sick. In summary, you have no vibe or interest in what is going on. The immersion is at a negative level\u2014that's how bland Ghostrunner really is.\n\nThe gameplay promised something exciting, like a cool first-person slasher, but it completely fails to deliver. The progression in this game is so \"interesting\" that you basically forget to manage it. Moreover, the skill progression is overly drawn out\u2014I have no idea why they made unlocking all features happen on the level before the last one. Fighting with enemies is just boring\u201495% of it involves repeating the same pattern as before. The boss fights are even worse\u2014I cannot remember the last time I saw such stupid and ultimately boring boss fights. Generally speaking, you have to do exactly what the game wants you to do. The design of the second boss fight is so poor that at first, I didn\u2019t even have the slightest idea what I was doing wrong. The problem is\u2014you must block attacks at the exact moment the game wants you to, even though you see the attack animation. If you attempt to block slightly earlier, the whole combo is reset. I have no idea who approved this...\n\nThe only positive thing about Ghostrunner is the graphics. It is certainly not masterpiece, but at least it looks cool and gleaming. However, if you look more closely, you will start to see some problems, but overall, especially when you are in action, it looks quite good and nice.\n\nSo generally speaking, Ghostrunner has just a shining wrapper, behind which lies an incredibly mediocre and boring product. And the main problem is that everything in this game is so average that, in the end, you gain nothing\u2014you just regret wasting your time.",

          "content": "It is obvious that a lot of care went into this game. It has a fine plot, challenging combat, a superb art style, and pleasant music.\n\nThe most striking aspects of this game are the art style and the Souls-like combat. The Rats vs. Frogs war theme, combined with the 2D hand-drawn art result in gorgeous and distinctive visuals. Also, the executions and light green frog blood are a nice touch.\n\nThe combat is tough and mostly fair. The main issue I have with it applies to the bosses/bigger enemies. You usually have to be close to damage them, meanwhile, they have unblockable (but dodgeable) attacks that cover half, and sometimes, the whole screen. Later enemies also dodge a lot of your attacks. Ranged attacks are limited and weak, so it\u2019s best to save for the finish. Thankfully, I had patience and I was never stuck on one fight. Finally, the weight system was poorly implemented and the abundance of gear you obtain is pointless, but those are mostly nitpicks.\n\nThe game is short, but the free \u2018Bloody Whiskers\u2019 expansion adds a few more enemies to fight and contains a startling secret. This is simply a well-made game across the board on a developer\u2019s first try. Impressive.",

          "content": "The story is pretty simple with you being a prince whose father is killed by some evil Frogs and now you need to rebuild the kingdom and get your revenge. The story was nothing to write home about, but it was enough to keep me going and I felt it had some good moments throughout. While the characters aren\u2019t voiced the game is narrated by actor Doug Cockle, who of course voices Geralt in the Witcher games, and as someone who is a big fan of that series it was a real treat to get his VO here! The man could read the phone book to me and I would be captivated the whole way through!\r\n\r\nCombat has that souls-like feel of dodging, blocking and parrying but thankfully there are difficulty settings which is great for me since I\u2019m not that into challenging games. The easy difficulty felt good for me in that it was more forgiving but not brain dead easy and I did die a few times to bosses. The combat does feel very good though, with the hits feeling weighty and satisfying to perform and your character will even perform executions on bigger enemies which are fun to see. Alongside that you get a pretty nice variety of weapons and armors to find which always makes completing quests or defeating bosses satisfying since you get that great reward at the end of it.\r\n",

The genre has become packed with average games, as the mechanics of a never ending game appeals to developers as it gives more value for money for the player. Hades by Supergiant Games is anything but average. Every aspect of the game is astounding and it shows how outstanding games can be made in early-access. Find out why in my Hades Nintendo Switch review.\n\nDeveloping Hell\n\nHades was announced almost two years ago at the Game Awards. Since then, it has been worked on, developed for and optimised until its Switch release on September 17th. In a documentary made by No Clip, you can see that this pivot to early-access was not easy for the developers at Supergiant Games. However, the extra time to make Hades has made it one of the best indie games on the Nintendo Switch and my personal game of the year for 2020.\n\nEscaping Hell\n\nThe story of Hades is based on Greek mythology and the little known God of Rebirth, Zagreus. Zag is the Prince of the Underworld and going through an angsty teenage phase. After an argument with his father, Hades, God of the Underworld, Zag decides enough is enough. He wants to join his wider family up on Mount Olympus. The young Prince grabs his father\u2019s sword and leaps out of his bedroom window and tries to make his way through the four levels of Hell to escape to the surface.\n\nObviously, escaping Hell is no easy feat. So, Zag will need some help along the way. His relatives up on Mount Olympus hear of his quest and decide to help him by granting him powerful Boons, which give his attacks special powers. Nevertheless, even the grace of the Gods is not enough to break free from his father\u2019s realm and Zag is defeated. Luckily, he is the God of Rebirth and cannot really die. Once he is defeated, he is respawned at the House of Hades, which is the central hub for the game.\n\nHouse of Hades\n\nThe House of Hades is despised by Zag but is a great place to get to know the residents of Hell. Here Zag can talk to Greek Legends like Dusa (Medusa), Achilles and even Death himself, Thanatos. It\u2019s here where you can upgrade Zag and the Underworld to make your future runs more successful. However, we will talk about that a little later.\n\nAn Ancient Greek Soap Opera \n\nWhen describing the story of Hades to players that have never played it before, I describe it as a soap opera. Sure, the main theme and aim of the game is escaping Hell. However, the main story is about family, and just happens to be about history\u2019s most dysfunctioning family.\n\nEveryone knows something about Greek Mythology. It may be from a history class back in primary school or from an episode of Hercules on the Disney Channel, but everyone knows at least some of the characters in Hades. \n\nThere are the main gods: Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, who all happen to be brothers. From there it is very interesting to see which gods and demons Supergiant added to the game. There is Aphrodite, the Goddess of Love, Ares, the God of War, Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, Dionysus, the God of Fertility and Wine and Hermes, the God of Luck and Travel. These are just some of the Gods in the game. All of whom are related in both close and distant ways. \n\nBecause of all of these interlocking relationships, the soap opera feel of the story is intensified. Gods who are siblings have ancient rivalries with each other and compete for Zag\u2019s attention like small children. They plot and argue together within the game, making me question if it really is a good idea for Zag to join them on Mount Olympus.\n\nGods and Monsters\n\nNevertheless, I always look forward to seeing the Gods in the game. Firstly, this is because their designs look fantastic. Artist Jen Zee has gone out of her way to create unique, interesting looking characters that are as diverse as they are powerful. It is so refreshing to see characters that are not all white. It gives the Gods depth and a believableness. This is because Greek Gods and Goddesses were not necessarily all from Greece, as pointed out in this Kotaku article.\n\nFurthermore, their writing is excellent and after about 20 hours of playing the game, I still have not come across any dialogue that repeats itself. It is amazing! What is even more impressive is that the dialogue throughout the game is reactionary to whatever happened in your last run. Therefore, characters will comment on how you could possibly beat the enemy that defeated you (or make fun of you for losing to them). I\u2019ve seen this sort of story-telling before in other indie games, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the extent and level Hades has.\n\nCombat\n\nRoguelikes/lites live and die on their combat. Obviously, if you\u2019re playing dozens or hundreds of hours of chopping down foes, it has to feel good. Hades has one of the quickest, best feeling combat mechanics I have ever played. In my opinion, it is even better than Dead Cells and knocks it off its podium of best roguelite on the Nintendo Switch.\n\nZag has three attacks and a dash move, and that\u2019s it. The three attacks are broken down to: Attack (Y), Special Attack (X) and Cast (B), with the Dash being on the A button. Though the combat seems quite simple at first, it is the addition of Zag\u2019s weapons that make it so addictive.\n\nWeapons\n\nAfter a few runs in the game you will have unlocked all six weapons in Hades\u2019s arsenal. There is: a sword, a spear, a shield, a bow, a pair of boxing gloves and a gun- yes a gun. While there is nowhere near as many weapons as Dead Cells, I still believe Hades feels better in both combat and the uniqueness of each individual run. Again, when looking at the weapon types, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything variety there. However, having put the game through its early-access paces, Supergiant have fine tuned Hades\u2019s combat to perfection. On its own, without any Boons from the gods, the combat is precise and brutal. When you add Boons to it it becomes, well- God-like.\n\nBoons\n\nBoons are upgrades from the Gods that will either temporarily upgrade Zag\u2019s stats, or add additional effects to your weapons. Each different attack can be upgraded by each of the gods, and each Boon has a rarity associated to it. For example, you may have a run where you are using one of Zeus\u2019s Boons on your regular attack, which will send out a lightning bolt every time you hit an enemy. Then you might have a Boon from Dionysus on your special attack, which will inflict Hangover (poison) on your enemies and do damage over time. On your cast you might have a Boon from Ares that turns your cast into a gust of whirling blades.\n\nFinally, on your dash you may have a Boon from Poseidon, which will cause a wave to knock-back enemies every time you dash. These are just a small amount of the Boons in the game, there are dozens that will make every single run feel totally different from the last.\n\nUnique Runs\n\nIn addition to the Boons, the way Hades makes every run feel unique is by giving the player a choice to make after clearing every room. Doors will appear with icons on them that show the player what item they will be rewarded with if they beat the next room. This gives the player the control to shape how they want their run to go.\n\nSure, the actual Boons received may be randomised. However, giving the player all of the decision making to decide for themselves is something I\u2019ve not yet seen in a roguelite. Mostly, players have to wander blindly through a dungeon and are rewarded with random upgrades, which often may not even help the player. This is not the case in Hades and I love it! Every upgrade or item is useful and helps make both Zag and the player better at the game, pushing them further towards the surface. \n\nProgression\n\nAlongside combat any roguelike/lite worth its salt needs to have a rewarding progression system. The game is hard- all roguelites are. However, if progression is done well a player should want to load up the next game straight away after a death instead of feeling bitter about the death. Again, because of its time in early-access, I believe Supergiant have knocked it out of the park with the progression system in Hades.\n\nThere are about seven different items that are persistent throughout the game. That means that even if you die in a run, you will return to the House of Hades with these items. They are: Darkness, Gems, Keys, Nectar, Titan Blood, Diamonds and Ambroise and all act as a type of currency that can be used to upgrade Zag and the House permanently. I\u2019d argue the most important of the currencies are Darkness and Gems. Darkness is used at the Mirror of the Night and will upgrade Zag\u2019s moveset and stats permanently. Gems are used at the Construction Table and add extra challenges and rooms to Hell that will help you get further in a run.\n\nAlways Achieving Something\n\nThe progression is done so well that after each death you return to the House feeling like you achieved something in the previous run, and more importantly, that the next run will be better. The game is so well balanced that you are given just enough of a reward and incentive to keep persevering. This is something other roguelites fail to do. It was the biggest problem for me in Dead Cells and Neon Abyss. This is because I felt like I was never getting further in a run and always dying to the same bosses because there were no persistent upgrades making me better.\n\nThis is simply not the case in Hades. After getting to grips with the bosses you can beat them consistently because you as a player have improved and so has Zag. It means you will progress and keep progressing until every run is a success. Eventually getting you further and further until you \u2018beat\u2019 the game. It is something most roguelites never do, in fact, I think Hades is the only roguelite I\u2019ve ever \u2018beaten\u2019. That is not because it is easy, but because Supergiant want you to win and wants you to experience the amazing story that is interwoven within Hades.\n\nArt\n\nJen Zee\u2019s art style has set Supergiant Games apart in the indie scene. When you see a Supergiant game, you know it is a SuperGiant game because of Jen\u2019s wonderful art. Hades is no exception to this. I\u2019ve already spoken about the Gods, but the other characters, even the bosses in the game also look wonderful.\n\nHell itself has never looked so good! With each level having its own unique look, theme and colour palette. I love the contrast Tartarus and Asphodel\u2019s dark walkways have compared to its green lights and neon orange lava. Elysium on the other hand, feels almost heavenly, with its luscious looking gardens and vivid turquoise theme. It is one of the few dungeon-crawlers I have ever played that I\u2019ve taken the time to actually explore the dungeon and really appreciate the high level of art on show there.\n\nMusic and Sound Design\n\nAlongside Jen Zee\u2019s art, Darren Korb\u2019s score and sound design is another aspect that sets Supergiant apart from other developers. The score in Hades is both whimsical and heavy at the same times. It reminds me of being on holiday in Greece while at the same time having deep, heavy metal riffs that fit the brutality of the combat (and the game) perfectly. I am actually listening to the soundtrack as I write this review.\n\nIn addition, the voice acting in Hades is superb, with Korb himself acting Zag and Skelly. Supergiant staple Logan Cunningham is back to voice the God of the Underworld and many other characters like Poseidon and Achilles. There must be thousands of lines of text in this game and in my 20 hours of playing, every single one has been absolutely nailed. It\u2019s also interesting to note that other members of the Supergiant team voiced characters in the game too.\n\n\nFinally, the sound design of the weapons and attacks in Hades adds so much to the pleasure of the game. It is really one of those games you cannot play with the sound off because it helps so much in combat. Little audible cues signal when your combos are finished and adds a subconscious reaction telling you to dash away. Throughout, Hades is a wonderful sounding game- all Supergiant games are. But in Hades\u2019s case, Darren Korb has outdone himself!\n\nGame of the Year\n\nHades is a triumph of a game and shows what early-access indie games should be in 2020. Supergiant Games is one of the best indie game developers there is and they have shown their class and skill with Hades. Everything in the game is perfect from its art and music, to combat and narrative. There is not one bad thing I can think of about this game, it is simply perfect.\n\nIf you are skeptical of the roguelite genre, Hades is the one game that will get you addicted to them. Its progression systems are rewarding, making you want to have \u2018one more run\u2019 rather than throwing your controller through the screen after a death.\n\nThe story, though simple at its core, is enthralling and makes me want to keep playing over and over to find out the conclusion to Zag\u2019s story. I think this has a lot to do with the excellent writing of Greg Kasavin and the amazing character designs of Jen Zee. I\u2019ve become so interested in Hades that I\u2019ve been Googling and reading up on Greek mythology, to get a better understanding of how all of these Gods, Spirits and Monsters intertwined.\n\nIn my eyes there is no question that Hades is my Game of the Year. Honestly, if we didn\u2019t live in a world where graphics rule awards, I would say it should be Game of the Year, that is how good it is. If anything in this review has piqued your interest about the game, please, please try it out. It is truly an outstanding, once in a generation game that should be played by everyone from heaven to hell.",

          "content": "Moonlighter is a roguelite shopkeeper sim. You inherit a small run down shop near mysterious, regenerating dungeons. The town has seen better days, and you delve into the dungeons to find the keys to unlock the fabled 5th dungeon, and bring prosperity to your shop, and to the town.\n\nRight off the bat, this is a great looking game. I enjoyed the pixel art and style of the game immensely. The shopkeeper and roguelite mixture is interesting, and adds a bit of uniqueness to a crowded genre. The pace of the game takes you into the dungeons, where you fight hard and collect loot to sell in your shop. You then use the proceeds to upgrade your shop, and build weapons, armor and potions to get you deeper into the dungeons. On the third floor of each, you will fight a boss, and retrieve the dungeons key. \n\nOn the downside, I found the roguelike elements to be a tad weak. There are no in-dungeon powerups, making each run feel same-y, as you can only use up to two weapons per dungeon. This was not a game ender for me, but did detract from my enjoyment in a rather large way. ",

You play in areas which are intentionally non-linear, confusing, and maze-like. You have to find certain items or perform a certain action to advance to the next stage. The combat is challenging and all about dodging and managing stamina. I see how all of this might sound very interesting for gamers, as something like this has not been released for ages, as these are tropes of old video games. It is absolutely not my cup of tea. I am the type of person who wants to explore every corner of the map, so I get overwhelmed with games like these, especially when death is a possibility all the time. ",

          "content": "Sometimes a meta-game comes out that really nails the nostalgia, feeling, and gameplay style of older video games. Tunic has scratched that itch for me. This is a game that pays heavy homage to the games of yore, with a modern coat of paint, soundtrack, and mechanics. Without spoiling anything, the mechanics of the game are discovered as you play, which gave me some moments of discovery that were enjoyable to experience. The visuals in this game are stunning; I have snapped a few for desktop backgrounds, and the world-building and visual homage's to Zelda games are splendid and delightful. Mechanics are often unlocked over time, and the game contains a unique language, ready for the player to figure it out, and offering almost no hand holding to discover the goods. The soundtrack here is also excellent; I listen to it frequently, and it is atmospheric, ethereal, and excellent. \n\nGameplay-wise, Tunic plays like a top down \"Zelda-like\" with interesting mechanics, loads of potions, and items to utilize, and a few excellent combat and defensive maneuvers that contain depth through learning some control hacks to elevate the abilities. The combat is tough as nails; bosses and enemies are tough, and players will need to learn patterns and die numerous times in game to learn how to defeat enemies - and sometimes this only occurs by the skin of one's teeth. I fought one boss in this game dozens of times, giving me some Dark Souls vibes for combat and boss encounters. \n\nI did find some of the areas of this game, including the final boss, to be onerously difficult, and this is one of the only downsides for me in this gaming experience. To me, this was an excellent homage to smaller adventure RPG titles, and it is one of the best examples in class, in my opinion. Easy recommendation if any of the above sounds of interest. ",

It's easy to learn but hard to master playing the songs, and requires you to really learn them to play them well on the harder difficulties.\n\nThe song selection is great, featuring music from a lot of artists that don't get a lot of attention, as well as some bigger names. Every song fits well, and there are a wide variety of genres to choose from. I do wish they were organized a bit better though, as sorting through them to find a particular song is a bit difficult without the wiki open in front of you.\n\nThe presentation is very pleasant and relaxing, while at the same time hiding a lot of deeper meaning. I wish the cutscenes were a bit more in-depth and that we had more time to spend with the characters though.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10",

The biggest upgrade is the removal of vagueness when it comes to perks' effects and damage numbers. Also, they added character models and a vastly improved soundtrack (I'd always mute music in the first game and put on Spotify). The progression system feels rewarding and I like how you can choose your initial loadout instead of having randomly chosen for you after sitting through a loading screen. I'd always just immediately surrender when I initially got a weapon I didn't like in the first one. Overall, I'm really excited to see what this game will become on release. Anyone who plays games like Overwatch and Apex Legends will enjoy this.",

          "content": "EARLY ACCESS REVIEW\nI really enjoyed this game. One of my favorite aspects of REDO! is having to map the game world out in your head. The game accommodates this by making the world just small enough that the process of doing that isn't straining whatsoever. By the end of the game you are intimately familiar with the locations and the routes to them which feels very rewarding. The kick down ladder short cuts are a simple but nice touch too because they push you to explore the world to make it more interconnected and easy to navigate. The ladders and the save points feel really good to discover because they are just limited enough to make it feel like you've earned finding them. The art style is fantastic. It can be subdued in a lot of areas but that helps it build up to some of the really impressive rooms you get to explore. The sound design created a very tense and mysterious atmosphere. The combat was really fun to learn. I liked how each item I found that I didn't understand at first had an enemy that it was perfect for. Some were more useful then others, the riot shield felt useless because of the bubble shield and energy beam, but I used every one I obtained for something. I loved the enemy and boss design. The story is the only thing I was hit or miss on. It's serviceable and I liked reading any diary entry I found but it ultimately lead up to an ending that felt like an anti climax. The journey was better than the destination in this case. It's still in early access so maybe the hardcore mode ending will be better.\nI recommend it if you like a challenging but fair game.",

It becomes a guesswork in what you can and can't do, because the rules are not very clear with the increasing complexity. And to me, that was very frustrating.

          "content": "Overwatch 2 is a squeal to a game that never needed a squeal.\r\n\r\nI personally enjoy the game when I'm not getting railed by the Winston one trick smerf on the other team or when my Lifeweaver teammate is not throwing because of silly haha Twitter and YouTube views. This game can genuinely be fun and enjoyable in the right scenarios. May I also add that just like the weird free mobile app you installed last night that kept pushing ads and shoving microtransactions in your face, Everything in OW2 is optional. From Battle Passes, to skins, to taunts. So from everyone in this review page complaining about the Free-to-Play model that OW2 has taken is completely useless and is not worth complaining about in the first place.\r\n\r\nSomething I will say is valid to complain about is the PVE that they did promise back in 2019 I believe (That from my understanding started development back in 2016) that is also the only reason for a \"2\" to be placed at the end of \"Overwatch\". While the PVE was canceled it's still here and is $15... Remember when I said buying anything in this game is optional I mean this BIG time with the PVE. From what I have seen from PVE on YouTube, the missions are like 15 to 20 minutes long maybe and are not worth the $15 at all. The story the PVE is telling is also just bleh in my opinion. If you like story and want to spend $15 on 3 15-20 minute story missions that are here to tell us lore on a story hundreds of people have been waiting 7 years for that also starts talking about what there \"was\" but we have not never seen or heard of the story of the \"what was Overwatch\" then go ahead and slip your 15 into Blizzard's wallet!\r\n\r\nGameplay wise the game is fun, OW2's competitive nature makes it a little angering after a while but it's still fun nonetheless. But back to the \"competitive nature\" thing I said, Overwatch 2 is a competitive MMO shooter that was made by a company that (from what I know) has never made a competitive shooter in their lives. Nothing can change my opinion of this game being forced to become a competitive game, the facts are all there, Overwatch League is on death support and Half if not most of the competitive streamers have been playing Quick Play and custom games It's mot much but It's enough for me if I get the see the OWL fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nOver all this game is good but 1000% needs more improvements to make the game fun and engaging for both casual and competitive sides. If the next hero Blizzard releases follows what happened for the last two heroes of \"Oh this hero is shit\" or \"Damn this hero is overpowered as fuck\" for them to be nerfed and be useless or them to be buffed and still be useless.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The seasons are also kinda mid.\r\n\r\nUpdate 2: After BlizzCon 2023 - WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!

Both of these changes appear to prioritize monetization over player satisfaction due to FOMO and inseparable cash shop bundles.\n\nAmong the significant letdowns is the abandonment of the promised PvE Hero Missions and power progression. These were initially promoted as the game's unique selling points and the very reasons justifying the sequel. The emphasis has now shifted towards PvP modes. While we did receive Story Missions, they now come at a cost and are going to be infrequent seasonal releases. This absence of Hero Missions and progression creates a void in the gameplay experience, stripping away the anticipated core PvE mode.\n\nWhile Overwatch 2 retains the vibrant and captivating hero-based shooter that drove its predecessor to success, it stumbles notably in several aspects. Ongoing balance issues, disarray within the competitive scene, role queues, and character skins that often feel like mere cash grabs \u2013 straying frequently from the character's theme \u2013 all contribute to this setback. Furthermore, game balance itself faces a potential compromise, as new heroes remain inaccessible behind a paywall. As a result, those who choose not to pay may very well find themselves at a disadvantage in certain scenarios.\n\nThe game's visual and artistic components continue to amaze with intricate character designs and lively environments. However, these strengths can only go so far in compensating for the content deficiencies.\n\nThe potential of the rich and captivating world of Overwatch has been overshadowed by these questionable monetization tactics and lackluster decision-making. The game's unique heroes and villains deserve a better home where their stories and gameplay potential can flourish without being hindered by corporate strategies that prioritize profits over player satisfaction.",

Pixel art is very smooth and complements the game.\n\nAndrew Hulshult is composer here, he literally consumed every important part of different music that infuenced him and created exact sound that we need to hear through the meatgrinder FPS game. You can also know him by his work in Dusk, Quake Champions, Doom Eternal and other projects.\nFor me - music is a core for such game genre.\n\nYou can find different weapons for your taste - pistols, minigun, rocket launcher, plasma rifle, shotgun etc.\n\nLevel design is quite good in Prodeus, it never feels repetative, it pushes you to play game forward.\n\nSo if you're looking for some really smooth FPS experience and incredible music - this game is for you.",

It utilizes some simple mechanics - with the grappling hook being the primary one  - to offer some fun swinging and jumping in a cyber/outrun aesthetic.\nIf you have played \"A Story About My Uncle\", this one feels like its hardcore version (both in the setting and the gameplay). With that being said, I have one mildly important reason to be a bit disappointed by it. One of my biggest pet peeves in video games is when the difficulty scales exponentially towards the end, just to prolong the ending a little bit more. Whether this was done intentionally or not, the level design changed drastically from open spaces that offer different routes to achieve better times (in accordance with its \"speedrunning\" tag), to confined box-like spaces with insta-death \"lava\" surroundings, warping its identity from an open speedrunning platformer to a precision, muscle memory based, \"learn by losing\" platformer. While I generally don't mind the latter, it felt like a poor way to handle level design and scaling difficulty, forcing me to finish it with a feeling of doing a chore.\nThe story is very basic and doesn't even finish properly. I cannot complain too much since this is not what you're looking for in this genre. Controls are very responsive and a joy to adapt to. Music and graphics very atmospheric, I noticed no drawbacks on these aspects.",

          "content": "I picked this and another game, Vosaria: Lair of the Forgotten, on sale for the Xbox One in 2020. From trailers and pictures they looked like similar games from another major game company. I bring up the date. I played through the mentioned game first. It was short, a good challenge, and did not take me exorbitantly long to complete. I moved on to this one. According to submitted prior playthroughs, this should take around 15 hours. My first playthrough is tracked as almost 35. This may be skewed by how I ended up playing only a half hour then taking a few weeks away and end up redoing the same part several times. Real time speaking it did take me a couple years at that pace to play through the story on normal.\nAt first it felt real good. Armed with a bow and sword you go on your quest. Right away you will find that certain things will require a change of day to trigger. The mechanic of this is beds scattered all over. These are quite frequent and generous. Not only do they serve a function of day/night change, but also saving and restoring health. Believe me, testing out how far you can go without saving was a factor in the higher time it took me.\nThere's 9 different sections of the game, making up 4 environments and major parts. After completing the first part, you will likely be pretty filled to capacity with all the items carrying. Time to start upgrades. This is one of the problems I have. There's only a few options to choose at first and you can only really pick one. It'll take all your gold for that one. Then you have to go back around grinding for gold again.\nAt this point you will probably just want to progress the story to the next section. This is where I found the difficulty start to increase. Enemies start coming at you more often, they're faster, and take a lot more damage to defeat. Here is where you also find the standard pattern for the game. Fight through the first section, collecting 4 pieces before going to the next part to retrieve the part stating you passed to unlock the last trial. During this part of collecting the four pieces in the first section, you have to go talk to the merchant who is selling one of the parts for pretty much your maximum capacity of gold. I would be remiss to point out that no section is significantly huge and can be reached in a minute roughly once unlocked. Other than going back for upgrades, they are easily completed in one stretch and not needed again.\nI thought the enemy difficulty steeply increased after the second part, and found myself having trouble with progressing to the next little without stopping save point to save point. Couple that with a boss battle that required a lot of patience, while being battling with below intended power, made it very easy for me to drop the game for weeks at a time. After I got past the one boss I went and upgraded some of my stats and found it was a little easier to complete the game. My only problem at that point was finding a good solid enough time to make it through.\nOverall I found it a nice clone of a similar well known series. Given the way I played the first time I would not do that again. The difficulty increases makes it frustrating to want to continue on with low powered abilities. I do consider this about a three and a half star game (on a five point scale). The retro graphic style look good, music not very memorable, combat could be better with some defensive abilities other than just absorbing hits, and without having a big wallet early, it can be a grind to be able to get all the upgrades necessary to have a great amount of enjoyment. I do recommend it for the price I paid which was 99 cents when it was on sale, and in a way it supports the indie development.",

It's simply a zombie survival game, it doesn\u2019t do anything exceptional, it doesn\u2019t have great graphics or a story, but it's free so what more could you ask for. It's possible to even play with friends, if one decides to make a server. Don\u2019t forget the mods as well.\n \nStory\nAs I said, no story. There is some lore as far as I have heard, but it's so obscure in the many hours I played I never thought to look for it.\n \nMechanics and gameplay\nHave you ever played a survival game, like the ones where there is hunger, and you have to watch out for some kind of danger, and maybe there is also building? Well then, you\u2019ve practically played Unturned. In, I would say, boil down almost any survival game to its core and you get Unturned.\nThat\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t have any fun. There is no end goal, but for the 20 to 30 hours I spent simply building up my base and getting better gear, I was entertained. After a while, the realization that I was building up towards nothing came to me and I stopped playing.\n \nGraphics and artstyle\nI once saw someone refer to this game as \u201cMinecraft with zombies\u201d, which, ignoring the irony, give you an idea as to the graphical quality that should be expected.\n \nAtmosphere/Immersion  \nI still like Unturned after all it was part of my childhood. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t really say anything about its atmosphere \u2013 I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s real and what\u2019s just nostalgia.\n \nSoundtrack\nI barely remember the ost. I can recall just one song \u201cUnturned theme song\u201d so I guess that\u2019s also my favourite.\n \nFinal Thoughts\nEven after all these years, those zombies can still scare me.\n",

It's main combat gameplay is heavily borrowed from that game and it does well for the most part.\nHowever, the game is far too long (30h and a large part is still to come) and the gameplay gets very repetitive. Combat breaks down to a blocking phase and an attacking phase. To succeed in the harder battles, you have to master the timed perfect block mechanic. The attack phase is more freeform with one button associated to one of the 4 party members. There are a lot of party members you can recruit with different moves and abilities. It is fun to try out the different characters and how they can create combos with each other.\nUnfortunately, this got very repetitive for me. Many of the enemies have a large health pool and thus take very long. They also respawn each time you revisit an area and you cannot flee from combat once it has started.\nThe areas are diverse but you have to revisit them a few times which also got on my nerver.",

          "content": "On its face, Need Streamer Overload (Needy Girl Overdose in Japan) seems like a very simple management/visual novel hybrid about managing an anime girl's life as a streamer. Getting further into the game, one finds complexity both mechanically and thematically that make the game rise above others.\n\nThe simple mechanics of the game quickly open up, requiring the player to balance many competing stats in order to keep OMGkawaiiAngel happy and healthy. Also important is the deadline of 30 days to gain 1 million subscribers. These factors elevate the game above a simple visual novel into a management game that is very satisfying to play.\n\nWhere the game really shines is portraying the emotions and mental state of the streamer. The game tackles a lot of complex issues like depression, drug abuse, and loneliness. These themes get related to internet culture in a way that not a lot of games have tackled. The multitude of endings really allow the player to fully explore the streamer's mental state and provide tones of replayability.\n\nThe game's music and graphics complement each other really well, offering up a retro-modern vibe that is really enjoyable. The music will also mold to the streamer's emotional state, which is a nice touch.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10",

          "content": "The recent growth of technology, especially the internet, has raised an incredible amount of debates and fears about its effects on people and consequences on society in the short and long term. Although there are quite a few works in the art world that deal with the problems or results of the information society, in the medium of video games, it is not a concept that has been explored in many titles. Of course, there are works like \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream,\" based on the novel of the same name by Harlan Ellison, which, like other titles, delves into the idea of AIs taking over the world and human extinction. Most video games always take the post-apocalyptic side of the technology revolution, acquiring fatalistic and existentialist tones in most cases.\n\nHowever, I had never seen a game that dealt with the consequences and current problems of society, instead of a dystopian future. This is the case of the video game \"Needy Girl Overdose,\" which defines itself as an interactive visual novel, presenting a critique of the internet and the figure of the streamer, wanting to present mature and dark themes despite its cute aesthetics, based on Japanese anime.\n\nThis video game puts us in the skin of P-chan, our avatar and direct representation within the game as it has no gender or face, to serve as a direct bridge to Ame, the true protagonist of the story. And this is quite important because the whole game is based on Ame's relationship with the player and depends deeply on us getting fond of Ame, as technically, according to the narrative of the title, we are her partner.\n\nThe purpose of the game itself is to get Ame to fulfill her dream of being a streamer, giving you the direct orders of what to do to spend her time in pursuit of getting a million subscribers. You can do different activities, such as hanging out together, researching in forums, watching movies, or, of course, streaming.\n\nThe target audience for this game is apparently the gamer and otaku community, seeming at first glance (if you do not read the description of the game) a romantic title to have a good time. However, \"Needy Girl Overdose\" characterizes Ame as an adult with psychological problems and a childish mentality. She had a hard childhood because of school bullying, a bad relationship with her parents, and an incredible internet addiction that led her to become a \"Neet,\" that is, a person who has left school and does not work and usually dedicates herself exclusively to her hobbies.\n\nIt is almost funny how ironic it is that the target audience of this title is the object of criticism and mockery in it, as the game takes the opportunity on numerous occasions to show the selfishness, arrogance, and the need for attention of the protagonist, as well as the avoidance of reality to which Ame herself voluntarily submits.\n\nThis character in itself is a critical commentary, mainly towards certain \"social tribes\" of generation Z and later, showing the consequences of the information society on the personality and education of a young girl. Not only through its script, which we will talk about in more detail later, but also through its game mechanics.\n\nAs we said before, you, as a player, decide what Ame does. Each of the actions you do has a time cost, and you have a limit of 30 days to reach your goals. The activities you do will not only serve you to have new ideas for streamings but also have a direct impact on the statistics of Ame.\n\n\"Needy Girl Overdose\" is played in a similar way to \"Reigns.\" In \"Reigns,\" you make decisions that increase or decrease some of your resources: military power, religious power, money, and population. If any of these resources reaches its maximum or minimum, you lose the game. Ame works in the same way as your kingdom in \"Reigns,\" but its statistics are stress, affection, and mental state. Each of the activities you can do with her positively or negatively affects more than one of her stats in most cases. If you stream, it raises stress and lowers affection; if you spend time with her, it lowers stress but raises affection; if you take drugs with her, it lowers stress and raises her mental state, etc. The large number of actions you have at your disposal, the 30-day time limit, and the fact that each action affects different stats make \"Needy Girl Overdose\" a stressful experience due to the difficulty you have to manage her emotions, making this an unpleasant experience is actually a wise move as it exemplifies the fluctuating mental state of a person with psychological disorders and insecurities with a dependent relationship towards your person, portraying a toxic relationship of self-imposed emotional submission in which you are complicit.\n\nDuring the course of the days, Ame will talk to you on the phone (despite living in the same house), being the main way in which the narrative develops, talking to you at all hours and scolding you if you do not answer. Messages, most of which you can only reply to using stickers, not only continue with the idea that Ame has a deep dependency on P-chan but also make a satirical comment on the almost parasocial relationships that are established between young people, communicating primarily through images. A situation in which I myself find portrayed. The narrative of this title develops mainly with text messages in the in-game equivalent to WhatsApp, in addition to what Ame speaks in streaming and the tweets she puts in the equivalent of Twitter. Each of the three forms gives rise to different comments and subtexts about the person/internet interaction.\n\nDuring the Streamings, Ame takes the nickname \"Kangel,\" disguising and making herself up as a Japanese idol, putting on a figurative mask and adopting a completely different personality, much more friendly and self-confident, to please her audience, which she rarely breaks. Continuing the topic of fakeness in social networks, but what is really interesting about the streamings is the chat that you have to moderate by deleting negative messages. The script of the chat during Kangel's live streams is incredibly well written. Each of the messages looks like a comment from a random person on the internet. They are poorly written, use abbreviations and foul language, which gives a layer of immersion and reality that the game needs to keep playing with its credibility. Likewise, Ame's dialogues are brilliantly thought out, just like the chat. She writes in abbreviations, with misspellings, using insults and expressions clearly used by the 2000s generation onwards, which in the same way, contributes to the credibility and immersion of the character as a real person. This is really important to feel the right emotions in this game.\n\nWhile on Twitter, you, as P-chan, can read both her public account as Kangel and her private account as Ame, showing both sides of the same coin.\n\nWhen we combine the stressful gameplay with the storyline, then we begin to see the true colors of this game and its critical commentary. A young adult, completely in need of attention on social networks, with an extreme dependence on her partner, a perfect and untouchable facade as Kangel and another completely needy as Ame, who goes to the extreme of self-harm, drug abuse, and nymphomania in order to stay on the Hamster wheel of constant dopamine stimuli, all of them directly or indirectly due to the internet addiction she had since childhood.\n\nAlthough it is true that the approach to the idea of this game is incredibly striking, especially considering the times we live in, and its approach in its gameplay is correct when it comes to generating adequate sensations regarding the subtext of the narrative, the truth is that \"Needy Girl Overdose\" fails to get its message across.\n\nLet me explain. Even if I defend what I said above, \"Needy Girl Overdose\" has about 30 different endings depending on Ame's stats and our actions during the 30 days of gameplay. Although the description of the game itself encourages us to find a good ending, being all bad endings in reality, the game fails catastrophically when it comes to achieving a catharsis or, in general, a powerful emotion with any of these. Mainly due to the fact that the endings do not unfold in the narrative bit by bit due to the very nature of this title; rather, they are the spontaneous consequence of your statistics or your actions. In other words, when day 30 arrives, you have your ending, but on the way, there doesn't have to be any kind of conversation that has led to that point. For example, even if you have an ending where Ame breaks up with you because she has little affection for you, during the other 29 days of the game, she has not expressed that lack of affection in almost any way. It is true that the lack of love for you is a direct cause of your actions, but on a storyline level, there is almost no hint of the ending you're going to get because \"Needy Girl Overdose\" doesn't develop the conclusion of the route during the days you play. You simply see the end results, breaking the immersion in the world and character. Also, this gets the endings to not have the impact it should. For example, although all the endings are supposed to be bad, some of them seem good or neutral due to their lack of development. Similarly, some endings that in script are positive, the game itself poses them as bad endings or Game Overs, again, thanks to its lack of development.\n\nIt is surprising how the game gets it right for 29 days and then fails in its climax due to a design error from the early approach of the development. Also, the fact that there are 30 endings is a problem in itself because although this achieves a very organic and different first experience for each player, its script suffers for the same reason, in addition to the fact that the endings themselves eventually step on each other with similar concepts diluting the meaning of them. If you take this game as an experience in which you are only going to live a couple of endings, doing only a couple of routes, then you will not see these seams as clearly as I see them. However, the game itself encourages you to get all the endings, as the game load menu itself shows you a list with clues of all possible endings and confirming the existence of a secret ending when you get them all, which, without spoilers, is tremendously unsatisfying to experience for its obtuse dialogue and its lack of depth in the message.\n\nEven so, the end of a piece of art is nothing more than the final touch to it. Although they seem to me to be badly carried out, they have the ideas in place just like the rest of the game. And even if this one fails to develop many of the issues it wants to deal with (which are not few), \"Needy Girl Overdose\" is a breath of fresh air with respect to the criticism of the digital world, dealing with issues that I never saw portrayed before within the video game industry. So all in all, this title gets my respects. Plus, a tiny little hole in my heart, thanks to its way of exemplifying the flaws that unfortunately my generation has developed because of digitalization, including myself.\n",

Day in, day out\u2026the tedious grind of the life as a cog in the machine.  But one day something happens as you make your way to work, something that, ultimately, challenges your life as you know it and opens the door to something different.\n\nMosaic is a narrative-driven modern \u2018adventure\u2019 game where you play as a cog in the corporate world.  You wake up, brush your teeth and head to your job where you perform meaningless tasks day after day.  Mosaic has a beautiful art style with a drab color palette and blocky faceless characters that works well with the story it is trying to tell.  Through the gameplay you will run across things that brighten your spirit and those are represented by intense colors which seem jarring and out of place at first but are designed on purpose.  In addition, there are interesting and fun perspective puzzles which leave you just as confused as the protagonist and figuring out how to complete them is part of the fun.\n\nHowever, while beautiful and interesting in many places, Mosaic has its problems.  The game is rather dull throughout most of the runtime and, when coupled with the slowness of the character, leads to frustration.  And while this may be the main point of Mosaic, the dullness of modernity and daily life, it doesn\u2019t translate well into a game.  There are other issues with Mosaic, minor really when compared to the tedious gameplay, such as uninteresting achievements, slow progress, predictable ending, and high price tag.  It\u2019s not to say that the game is bad, but Mosaic has some issues and may be too \u201cartsy\u201d for many people.\n\nAs for achievements\u2026well, Mosaic has them.  All of the achievements are attained from the in-game diversion called Blipblop, a game that distills all mobile games into their pure form: repeatedly tapping the screen.  While it was fun for a while it quickly lost its glamor as time progressed.  Some of the achievements for this are easy others are extravagantly time consuming to attain.  While I normally would go after all the achievements there are several in Mosaic that are, quite frankly not worth my time and nobody should have to spend hours and hours clicking a button repeatedly just to get a perfect game.\n\nStrong concept, mediocre execution; the game\u2019s appeal is mostly in the visual design rather than the actual gameplay.  Mosaic is a very short game that some may enjoy and certainly others will not.  It does bring a message, even if a bit thin, but I would recommend waiting for Mosaic to be on sale before diving into this bleak world as the asking price is a bit steep for this type of game. \n",

It up to you, a recon specialist, to figure out what happened to the crew of this malfunctioning station.  Walk the mysterious dark hallways, enter the rooms of the crew and snoop around, perform tasks to fix the station, and keep your wits about you as you work on solving the mystery of The Station.\n\nThe Station is a short, first-person exploration game where you complete various projects and solve puzzles in order to access different parts of the station, thus helping to complete the story.  The story is quite rich indeed with little pieces hidden everywhere just waiting to be found if you investigate a bit.  When added with the sound logs you can puzzle together more information on the mystery.\n\nOverall this was an enjoyable game with beautiful graphics and an engaging story.  My only issue with The Station was that it was very short; but the story, the puzzles, and the graphics made up for its short run time.  The Station was a fun game where the clever puzzles and perfect space-mystery atmosphere was a joy to play and I look forward to more games like this from the developers!",

          "content": "This is easily one of the more enjoyable games i've had played recently. Only discovering it from Steam's Demo Fest as one of my more anticipated indie games for the year. It did hold up to my expectations. Mostly taking elements of other games like Pikmin &amp; Mario Odyssey, making it with its own unique twist to it. The controls for it being tight &amp; responsive.\n\nThe whole premise of it is that you're an alien that crashed into a house, and you're trying to repair yourself a ship to go back home. The general atmosphere that this game gives off is similar to 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' where you are exploring this massive human-sized room to you as the insect-sized player. there are plenty to chew in content with there being 3 side missions to the actual objective, along with collecting pollen.\n\nEach room in the house is littered to the brim with Tinykins. They act much like pikmin with the five types of tinykins that are in each of them come with their own unique abilities; ranging from igniting things up to flames, levitating, however they will not carry over level to level.\n\nThe Pollen in-game is the equivalent to Gems in the spyro trilogy in which they are spread around the entire room. Once you pickup a certain amount that is listed, you go and get a new bubble to levitate longer than you normally would. After that it's all extra from there to just to say \"I've done and seen everything\" with a cheevo to add on top of that.\n\nIn terms with my least favorite things about Tinykin is all honestly, it felt like it just was too short. As soon as you start to get your last new ability with one of the tinykins' it just feels like once you get past the other two levels left (including the one you are introduced to it) it feels almost left emptied out. With a game like this where it puts it's collectathon inspiration proudly on it's chest. I would personally love to master this title but it just feels like it's an a chore to do that when all you have left is searching around a level for the last dozen pollen that could possibly be anywhere, maybe something like an attachment to the binoculars where you can spot out where the last remaining pollen would at least make things more easier on mastering this game.\n\nI can easily recommend this game whole-heartily, especially if you love the 3D Platformers/Collect-a-thons. Definitely something that you could finish over a weekend. Hope that there is plenty of stuff to be added more in the future.",

          "content": "Boa noite, excelent\u00edssimos! Hoje vou postar a minha resenha do Carrion!\n\nDesde que vi o an\u00fancio dele em um dos shows surtados que a Devolver Digital faz na E3 fiquei muito interessado, mas acabei apenas pegando para jogar agora que assinei o Xbox Game Pass.\n\nPra come\u00e7ar, Carrion \u00e9 um jogo de \u201cterror reverso\u201d. Mas o que seria isso? \u00c9 um jogo que d\u00e1 medo?! Pera\u00ed, veja s\u00f3 a premissa do jogo: uma massa monstruosa, composta de incont\u00e1veis tent\u00e1culos e bocas com dentes afiados,  escapa da c\u00e1psula de um laborat\u00f3rio onde estava sendo estudada e sai por a\u00ed destruindo tudo e todos que aparecem em seu caminho at\u00e9 a liberdade. Aterrorizante? Nem tanto, por que quem controla o monstro \u00e9 voc\u00ea!\n\nA mec\u00e2nica principal do jogo aparece quando voc\u00ea percebe que dependendo do seu tamanho voc\u00ea recebe um kit de poderes diferentes, mas ao mesmo tempo altera o tamanho da sua vida. Para crescer voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 devorar humanos, e para diminuir voc\u00ea poder\u00e1 depositar um peda\u00e7o de sua massa em locais espec\u00edficos do mapa. Controlar o seu tamanho \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio para ultrapassar obst\u00e1culos, ou tamb\u00e9m para escolher como passar por inimigos altamente armados. Algumas sess\u00f5es de combate poder\u00e3o parecer desbalanceadas, mas desde que voc\u00ea se lembre de salvar constantemente isso n\u00e3o chegar\u00e1 a ser frustrante.\n\nExiste apenas um tipo de objetivo opcional, que \u00e9 o de encontrar todas as Unidades de Conten\u00e7\u00e3o, grandes c\u00e1psulas que, ao serem quebradas, melhoram algum de seus poderes. Estas unidades est\u00e3o bem escondidas, normalmente sendo necess\u00e1rio que voc\u00ea tenha que atravessar uma grande parte do mapa para um lugar que era previamente inacess\u00edvel. Por causa disso acabei n\u00e3o encontrando quase nenhuma quando joguei, portanto os upgrades n\u00e3o s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios para avan\u00e7ar na hist\u00f3ria principal, que \u00e9 bem superficial. \n\nPor ser um indie o jogo \u00e9 bem baratinho, mas tamb\u00e9m curto, provavelmente levando uma m\u00e9dia de 5 horas para alcan\u00e7ar os 100%, o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma coisa ruim. Pela sua simplicidade senti que o jogo tem o tamanho perfeito para n\u00e3o ficar enjoativo, tendo at\u00e9 uma DLC gr\u00e1tis chamada Greatest Time Of Year (Melhor \u00c9poca do Ano) para quem quiser jogar um pouco mais. A DLC dura por volta de 1 hora.\n\nNo final das contas Carrion \u00e9 um jogo muito divertido pra quem gosta de coisas bizarras, e quer algo simples e barato pra passar algumas horas. \n",

          "content": "Guilty or innocent?  Divinely guided or demonically possessed?  These are some of the questions you will ask as you find yourself trapped in a terrifying journey as a priest on a quest to prove his innocence.  Sin, guilt, and shame are explored as you traverse heaven, hell, and the indistinguishable realm in between that is the Gray Dawn.\n\nGray Dawn is classified as a Religious Horror; a little used theme for games and the first one of this subgenre that I have played.  I was impressed, horrified, fascinated, and sickened\u2014all in a good way.  Gray Dawn is a feast for the eyes in a first-person surreal world with photo-realistic realms overflowing with religious iconography, blood, and grotesquery.  The game doesn\u2019t hold your hand; instead you must figure out what to do next and solve simple puzzles.  While Gray Dawn is heavy on the atmosphere and story it is sadly light on the gameplay itself and I would have liked to have more puzzles to solve.\n\nThe story unfolds in a somewhat disjointed manner and the tale can seem a bit muddled at times.  You will be left with questions at the end of Gray Dawn, but I feel that this was the goal of the developers as a way to match the atmosphere of the game.  The sound of Gray Dawn works well with the game\u2014singing choirs, deep somber chords, and angelic sounds; but the voice acting was not the best (with a few exceptions) and the voice acting sometimes detracted from the overall experience.\n\nAchievements are easy to get as most of them are based on the story.  However, a few can be easily missed on the first playthrough and you will want to replay the game one more time to get the rest of the achievements and the alternate ending. \n\nPlaying Gray Dawn is like walking though someone\u2019s nightmare.  I found the game horrific and entertaining, and Gray Dawn easily kept my interest for the three hours that I spent experiencing a nightmare landscape and horrific story.  I recommend this game for those who may be interested in a good horror game that will stick with you for quite some time afterwards.\n\nThose that may be triggered by religious symbols, both the sacred and profane, along with those who do not want to listen to religious ideology, or those that may be upset by violent images that include children should probably avoid Gray Dawn.  However, if you are interested in a unique and memorable experience go ahead and give it a try.",

The dialogue can be lengthy sometimes, but the story was great, the characters had depth, and the turn-based mecha fights were fun and satisfying. You play as the protagonist, Dominic Shade, who manages Team Cowboy. Throughout the game, more of Shade's backstory will reveal itself, showing the player how he ended up reuniting with his close friends, Knife and Duque. Players can customize Cowboy with different kinds of parts that each have their own drawbacks and advantages, and the pilot, Knife Leopard, can equip various moves and stances, allowing the player to develop their own mecha-fighting playstyle throughout the game. Almost the entire game has high-quality voice acting. It also has a unique and stylish art style. Overall, Wolfstride was an experience that was like no other game for me, and I believe that it's a highly underrated indie gem.",

If you enjoy to learn about the motivations and backgrounds of different people, you'll enjoy this game!\n\nIt's about the big questions in life, relationships, and how to deal with sad events that happened in the past.

          "content": "An old woman on a homestead in the middle of nowhere spends her days collecting eggs, tending her garden, and turning goat milk into cheese.  From time to time a traveler arrives at the homestead bringing news from the outside world as well as trade goods that the old woman might need.  Reminiscing over her life, the old lady lives in loneliness as the days become shorter as Fall quickly turns into Winter.\n\nThe Stillness of the Wind is a third person limited farming simulator where you will harvest items in and around your small farm.  A traveler will appear almost daily to bring you news of the outside world, deliver any mail that you may have received, and trade for seeds, chickens, or items that you don\u2019t really need.  The main theme of the game is routine, and you will eventually develop a limited routine that will apply throughout your time in the game.  Controls are extremely easy (mostly falling on the point and click spectrum) and the game can be completed in a couple of hours.\n\nThe game is quite beautiful with a charming design and soothing soundtrack but do not expect exciting gameplay.  The stillness of the Wind is an awkward mix of cozy game and artsy storytelling where your repetitive tasks are affected by a decaying world with nothing that can be done to stop the inevitable.  On top of the repetitiveness of the game; the story is chock full of pretentious writing which, with the secondary story being confusing, only adds to the frustrating nature of a game that could have been good but sadly missed its mark.\n\nThe game prides itself on abstractness; from the world around the main character to the letters received daily from her friends and family.  However, too much abstractness can cause a lack of interest as well.  While I did look forward to receiving mail from strange and distant lands; the stories meant nothing to me and those letters, which were meant to expound upon the world, simply were a distraction from tedious chores around the farm.\n\nIt is important to note that there are no achievements for this game.\n\nI found The Stillness of the Wind to be more of a chore to complete than something I was excited to play.  While the art is beautiful the gameplay is tedious and slow.  I honestly feel that The Stillness of the Wind would have been better as an animated short film, but as a game it is just a frustrating experience.  As such, I would not recommend The Stillness of the Wind unless you are really interested in experimental games that offer monotonous experiences or, perhaps, want to try your hand at raising digital chickens.",

          "content": "I remember this game from so long ago that it was named \"Dragon Dating Simulator\". It eventually got a name change and tidied itself up to be more of a visual novel than a dating sim but I was still interested in it nonetheless. This game tells the story of how humans contacted a world of dragons by way of opening a portal to a parallel dimension. Now the humans and dragons work together and exchange knowledge and technology, but there is something amiss with the relationship. It's not all its made out to be. While going about your business in the dragon world there are a number of partners you can court (the player character's gender is never defined) and depending upon how you handle your interactions you'll be rewarded with CG's of the dragons in various poses and situations, none of it being explicitly pornographic however. While this is going on there's the main plot line to keep up with and it threatens to end your dragon romances and this ends with a culmination of all the main characters meeting in the same place to hash things out. I won't spoil the ending I got but I'll just say I think it was the worst possible ending in the game. Angels With Scaly Wings has been out for seven years but its companion comic \"Angels With Broken Hearts\" is still running and the developer is working on having plush toys made of the more popular characters as I write this review. Angels With Scaly Wings is still very much alive in 2023. It's a unique visual novel with a compelling story and I definitely think it's worth diving into if you have the time.",

The direction the creators went for is very suitable for the hot wheels universe fans, but also for people looking for an arcade racer with cool environments. However, as the game is now, it feels a bit unpolished, and looking to be made on the budget, so to speak. That will certainly be improved with future updates. When it comes to racing itself, it is fun, but if you play on your own, it has a limit. Kudos to the creators for including several difficulty settings for every level of player. Nice game for a few games and for online play, but if you can, wait a bit for the full collection with all the DLC's, cars and environments the game will have to offer.",

          "content": "\"Hot Wheels Unleashed,\" released in 2021, is available on multiple platforms, including PC. The game was developed by Milestone S.r.l, known for their work on racing games like the MotoGP series.\n\nThe game was published by Milestone S.r.l as well.\n\nThe director of \"Hot Wheels Unleashed\" is Michele Caletti. While there isn't a lot of information available about his previous game direction, he played a significant role in this title.\n\nThe game utilizes the Unreal Engine 4, a popular engine in the gaming industry. Unreal Engine has been used in numerous other games, including \"Fortnite,\" \"Gears 5,\" and \"Street Fighter V,\" among many others.\n\nRegarding gameplay, we find that Hot Wheels Unleashed is easy to handle but certainly challenging to master, requiring significant effort in some races on normal difficulty. This makes it more than just a children's product and turns it into a quite competent racing game.\n\nIt's a shame that the track setting becomes repetitive, and the purchasing system is based on loot boxes because, otherwise, it's a notable game that is definitely worth a try.\n\n\n",

It starts you out in a small region but soon you unlock other biomes.  The world starts slowly opening up, more and more.  The best part about this was that the world felt large enough to feel different but not large enough to where traversing was a labor.  The side quests and main quests were never boring but weren't challenging either.  They were simple yet satisfying.  The story was predictable but in a way it was nice to have something presented that was predictable.  Story/Gameplay aside the graphics were great.  I played in 4k and the game looked beautiful.  ",

          "content": "One of the nicest casual games that's not casual at all, Wilmot's Warehouse puts the player in a pleasant illusion of sortability. You, Wilmot, are expected to put things in their place. The more you do this, the more things you need to find a place for and there's only just so much warehouse for it all to go. This exercise in organizing gradually becomes an exercise in futility. Between long sessions of customer service, you are allowed to do stock take, essentially a \"free play\" time to clean your room or suffer in the levels that follow. There's no real way to anticipate what's coming unless you can afford an expensive upgrade, and the helper robot you're given, Borky, does about as good of a job as his name and :/ facial expression suggests. He also refuses to move an inch if you're trying to watch what he's doing. Things spiral out of control if you're not trying at all level over level which makes WW feel like Tetris in slow motion or, unironically, like a job. The only sad thing about this game is that it feels like a missed opportunity to teach the human player anything at all. As a person that struggles with organizing objects in a limited space in the real world, it makes me sad that I played this game for hours and only feel like there's no way to win either game. On the flip side, whatever methods you come up with become uniquely your own and people are keen to share their finished game screenshots which perhaps is an invitation to learn from other players\u2014people\u2014about how to become better the next time there's a mess of objects in front of you.",

As with most things the rule \"the first part is always the best\" works 100% for this one.\n\nThe first game hooked me up with incredible variation of settings, story and twists. This part doesn't have that. For the most part it's actually boring, it falls back on the \"OMG emotions\", but kinda fails to inspire any. Contrary to the first game, it has less interesting choices (or rather doesn't even pretend that your choices even matter). Most of the \"conflicts\" in the game are dumb, characters barely likable (except for the main protagonist of course), it seems like the writing for this one was done not out of inspiration, but mainly out of \"we_need_to_hit_them_deadlines\". And well, in a story-based game with barely no gameplay - bad writing is a no-go.\n\nOverall, if we consider the first game 10/10, this one is 7. And I would prefer I've never played it just because it ruined the good name of Walking Dead (the game) for me.",

          "content": "CloudPunk is a game that on name alone would have you hope that the sky is the limit. I went into it hoping a futuristic steam punk world that meets a compelling narrative as you dive deeper and not only develop your character but choose the destiny in which your protagonist sets her destination towards. Instead CloudPunk let's you know real quick that the limit is the sky in which you fly around in, and are confined to it's stereotype characters, one track storyline where there are little decisions you can make, as you realize once passed the clouds, this game somewhat resembles a visual novel with a set pace and only one destination. Without going into any spoilers, you play a character who has taken a new job as a courier for what seems to be a less than reputable delivery service who seems to go through employees constantly, which the former couriers all meeting a forced early retirement as insinuated by your dispatcher. One would think your character would take that as a hint to maybe think twice about continuing on with this job, but she decides to continue along, even with it's low paying scale. Looking at prices when you buy items from street vendors, drug dealers, and food stands, those characters all seem to make more money on selling a few of their items than what you make on a starting delivery. I know I am debating the imaginary economy of a game, but it does have me question that our protagonist would be way better off opening up a soup stand than delivering who knows what. But since she insists to continue delivering for some reason, the one helpful tip the dispatcher gives her is to not ask any of the customers whats in the packages. First thing your character does? She asks whats in each package. She pries into the personal lives and activities of each NPC she comes across, who all give her some sort of attitude, or hint that they dont want a conversation with her, and yet she insists. I would be fine if this was a dialogue option in which I choose if my character wants to be curious or if I want her to just do her job. But there is no option, it's just sitting back and seeing your character cringefully get into other people's business, where you would hope one would realize that asking too many questions (or any question at all for that matter), might be risking your life. Unfortunately your character decides to poke into the lives of each stereotypical character she comes across, coming off somewhat intrusive in some cases. The one npc that seemed that wanted to talk to her (known as a loud broadcaster i believe in achievements unlocked), she instantly brushes off for being a \"bro\" and we get the stereotype of a bro attitude from the npc, that was not initially established when he approached her, so it kinda comes off that she was rude at first to him and thus he is just reacting negatively towards her, rather than the \"bro\" being the rude one from the start, from my perspective. So after seeing that I really have no dialogue options, and that this game consists mostly of delivering from point A to point B (or Point C if you choose to do something different, this is where you can only make choices in the game it seems), i decided to see if i can take decisions into my own hands....by crasing the Hova Delivery vehicle. Can we get it to explode? Can we get the engine to stop running? Will we fall from the sky? After spending around 30 minutes crashing into other vehicles and buildings/structures, other than my vehicle emitting plenty of smoke and a few sparks, as well as moving slowly, it still was capable to reach destinations albiet it a slower pace. So then I wanted to see what would happen if I run out of fuel, surely then the engine stops and I've made a critical decision that could potentially end the game, correct? No. I recieved a few warnings from the AI installed in the cab, as well as from the dispatcher, but when my tank reached zero, my vehicle still floated, still moved (at a very slow speed), and in game it mentions that it runs on some other power source that makes sure you are able to make it to the closest gas station. Maybe in later stages of the game the training wheels or plot armor disappears and a game over could come to fruition from such potentially fatal decisions, but it definitely doesnt happen throughout my gameplay of the game. Realizing that I felt I had little decision into what happens to my character, and that there isnt any real risks of damage to my vehicle, I felt that the clouds dispersed and that I was punked from the experience i had hoped to play. With that being said, I do love the graphics and the setting, which when we think of Steam Punk or future iterations of our world with flying cars and all, this game captures that setting just right with the pixelated graphics that gives off this adorable touch to the world your looking at. Which is funny because this setting is defined as grimmy and dark and yet you find the beauty, the allure of it all, at least aesthetically. Unfortunately the story and the character didn't appeal to me, nor that I felt that I could take helm in this adventure and live vicariously through my protagonist, and rather I was just in the backseat of a broken down sky taxi set on a course that wasnt mine to make. You might have a better experience in the game, and if I gave it more time (Steam mentions I played this game for more than 2 hours) maybe the story would develop more to my liking, but I wish I had more control with the choices and whom my avatar would be in this world from the start. Cloudpunk is available on PC and has mostly positive reviews on Steam. ",

          "content": "An old machinist plots his escape from Communism and starts out on a perilous journey on the road towards freedom\u2014will he survive the many dangers and be free of oppression and tyranny?\n\nBlack the Fall is a beautifully crafted side-scroller puzzle platformer game where the puzzles are fresh and intriguing and oftentimes leave you scratching your head while trying to figure it out.  The macabre scenes, while often shocking, lend to the oppressive atmosphere and enrich our connection to the protagonist.  Overall, the puzzles along with the setting are quite memorable and makes for a good game that remains with you for quite some time.\n\nThe controls are somewhat easy, with my only difficulty being with the laser pointer required for a good percentage of the game.  I just didn\u2019t have the speed and accuracy enough until the middle of the game once I got used to it.  However, those players that are already familiar with the controller should have no issue navigating the world and puzzles.  Another bonus to Black the Fall is when you fail at a puzzle, and by fail I mean die, you are brought back very close to where you were before failing and you are allowed to try again as many times as it takes to complete the puzzle\u2014this style of autosave I liked and was very thankful for.\n\nGetting all the achievements is made easier by the chapter select feature though many, if not all, of the achievements are well hidden and can be difficult to find without a guide.  If you are a completionist I recommend finding a good guide online for this game.\n\nOverall, I found this game challenging with an impressively gloomy and depressing backdrop and engaging narrative.  The game is quite memorable with a great story to be told and the ending was quite satisfying.  I can easily recommend Black the Fall for those who enjoy puzzle platformer games.",

          "content": "Before I uninstall Apex Legends, I am going to leave some notes about this game. Personally, I cant say this game sucks, because I am suck playing the Battle Royale shooter game, so in case of curiousity. I play the game for sake of tasting the bits of Battle royale hype and current trend for gaming mode. \n\nGenerally, the game is well polished and has astonishing look with its realism. I am not familiar with the campaign cause its said the \"story\" or \"lore\" based on Titanfall which I am not interested to play. \n\nPeople say a game sucks because they dont know how to play it. And this game takes a lot of aspects I dont really like. I can shoot people and have fun with it. But playing a game where you have to run for 10 minutes and get gun where a final moment to win the game based how last you kill someone or get killed bores me sometimes, but why I still play it? Because Apex has particular skill with each characters where this game combined Hero shooter mixed with battle royale. \n\nUnfortunately, playing the game several times makes this game becomes so stale and nothing new to improve player experience where win based on luck and doing nothing on empty arena where players just run and loot some boxes (So, its not fast paced shooter which I dont like). \n\nThe characters design seems okay-ish but I predict it will not make developer getting successful skins selling with just bland recolor and \"not enough\" waifu (so if you want to some cute girls or sexy women) this has no sign for you. I hate generic pretty boy and girl character design in most of Battle royale mobile though, but i dont know it seems the characters are just being there, but still each players have its own skill where player can master to help winning the game. \n\nSo, based my judgement for 5 hours playing and trying this game, I can say this game has potential, but considering BR is just a fad like fidget spinner, I can say this game is good fidget spinner where at first you are impressed with its looks, but get tired everyone make their own fidget spinner. \n\n6.6/10",

The movement in this game is the greatest strength, it is fun to explore the options the movement system creates for the player. The different legends all have unique personalities that are fun to discover. I play on PS4 and the servers are hit or miss. Sometimes the game runs fantastic, other times it is a horrible mess. As mentioned earlier I play with my three friends. The main game mode in this game is for squads of three, which limits how we are able to play together. I would enjoy a permanent duos game mode for when all four of us would like to play so that we are not forced to cooperate with random unpredictable teammates so often. My final issue is with some of the legends. There are a clear few legends who are much better than others. The abilities of legends such as Pathfinder, Gibraltar, and Wraith are way too good when compared to someone like Octane or Mirage. I would hope that as the game progresses, so does the balance of the characters. Overall, Apex Legends is a very fun game that I see myself and my friends sinking hundreds of more hours into in the future.",

And when I learned that this game is only playable with at least one other player on the team, that really upset me. There was a period of time where I played this game a lot, but when I want to casually play the video game by myself, I still needed to have a teammate with me. I don't care about my battle royale ranks or where skilled-based matchmaking places me, but that doesn't mean the one other player on my team does as well, so if I am trying to chill out and casually play the game without a care in the world if I die or win, that will suck way more for the teammate that wants to get in higher ranks.\r\n\r\nThe maps were fine; I didn't like that they swapped out every few hours; the guns were nice to shoot; and the characters could have been better. Really, my main complaint about the game was the lack of replayability, the lack of solo play, and the lack of interesting updates.",

Scapegoating Linux is going to accelerate the cheating problem, too: Cheaters will see this as an admission that there is no working defense against them, and the pursuit of ineffective strategies and scapegoats will give them room to proliferate. Compare Overwatch (say what you want about it, it functions nearly cheater-free with active Linux players) with Call of Duty (cheat city, in spite of kernel-level protections in windows and no Linux access) and you'll see how these strategies play out.",

I don't blame you for that, but, I gotta say moments like this really make me think you got a bright future ahead of you. \n\nOMORI had all the hallmarks of a future PIXELS ARE ART champion. The oh-so-quirky trailer from its Kickstarter campaign mixed crayon drawings, kooky music, and RPGMaker in a way that didn\u2019t so much say \u201cthis is inspired by Yume Nikki and Earthbound\u201d as shouted for the world to hear! Its director, OMOCAT, had never worked on a game before. And after raking in over $200,000, the project basically went radio silent for six years, leaving bakers waiting for something to happen. Even when it reemerged in late 2020, it did so into a world drawing in indie games that all claimed to deal with \u201cheavy topics\u201d like depression and anxiety.\n\nBy all rights, /v/ should have torn this game to shreds. But OMORI did not succumb. It takes a lot of balls to admit you like anything on /v/, so seeing the reception OMORI\u2019s enjoyed \u2013 hell\u2013 it even got some nominations for Least Worst this year. It\u2019s been heartening to say the least.\n\nSo, here\u2019s to OMORI. The game that proves that sometimes, in spite of everything, it\u2019s going to be okay.",

I was interested in what happens next; I liked the relationship between two brothers and cared about their fate and journey. \r\n\r\nSince the brothers are on the run, the environment is changing all the time. For some people, it's not a good thing, but I like it because every episode looks fresh. \r\n\r\nSoundtracks are spot-on. The gameplay is very similar to first Life is Strange, but instead of time rewinding, you can ask your brother to use his telekinetic powers. And, since Sean is an artist, instead of taking photos, you can sketch, and I loved it.\r\n\r\nCompared to life is strange 1, graphics are highly improved. The environment is so beautiful I did tons of screenshots of landscapes. Character model design is not at the same level as environment design, but it's not bad either. I like hair animations of Daniel when he uses his telekinetic powers, but it's still and plastic on other characters.\r\n\r\nThe game has several endings; You have a lot of hard choices to make, and they matter in the end, although sometimes whatever you choose, the result is the same. \r\n\r\nLike in most of the games there are a bunch of bugs too but nothing serious. For example, characters walking on furniture, invisible walls, characters standing in T-pose, punctured hand by walkie-talkie, and others.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that annoyed me was that there is too much politics in it. And there are so many racists on Sean's path that it becomes a little bit unrealistic and forced. For this reason, I am giving it eight stars instead of nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "content": "TL;DR\n\nThis game feels like it was made in the 1990\u2019s\u2026 and I love that.\n\nGeneral Thoughts\n\nAs a JRPG fan who grew up in the 90\u2019s, Square Enix\u2019s SNES and PS1 era JRPGs were a huge part of my childhood. Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy IX are two of my favorite games of all time. Suffice to say, I\u2019m a sucker for games that cater towards this nostalgia.With that being said, my experience with \u201cI am Setsuna\u201d so far is everything I could have wanted or expected from a game like this. \u201cI am Setsuna\u201d is by no means the best game of 2016, but if you go in expecting to experience what it\u2019s like to play your favorite 90\u2019s JRPG for the first time again, you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nThe good\n\nMusic\n\nMy words would not do the music any justice, just listen. The music in this game, consisting mostly of solo piano pieces, is haunting, full of emotion, and absolutely carries the game. The soundtrack has an amplification effect on all aspects of the game. The characters, settings, story events, even the gameplay all feel more \u201cfull\u201d due to tracks that perfectly set the tone throughout the game.\n\nGameplay\n\nWhile the gameplay isn\u2019t exactly deep or challenging so far, it is still very satisfying. The battle system is very similar to that of Chrono Trigger, while the equipment/skill system is similar to Final Fantasy VII. Skills aren\u2019t acquired through levels, they are acquired by combining loot obtained from monsters. The way the drop/loot system works is genius and something that I wish more JRPGs would try to emulate. There are no random drops from enemies, instead, enemies drop items when you satisfy certain conditions with the way you defeat them. If you satisfy multiple conditions, you will get all of the items for the conditions that you satisfied. For example, if you defeat an enemy with a powered up lightning based attack, then you will get two drops from the enemy: one for defeating them with a powered up attack and one for defeating them with a lightning based attack. Random drops are extremely frustrating; This system feels like a breath of fresh air for the JRPG genre.\n\nScale\n\nThe game oozes \u201csmall budget production\u201d in almost every aspect of the game, but this is a good thing. The budget (or lack thereof) forced various design decisions throughout the game. The developers didn\u2019t have the budget for an overwhelmingly amount of side quests to distract you from the surprisingly personal story of sadness and suffering that this game tells. The developers didn\u2019t have the budget to populate the world with hundreds of NPCs in tens of towns, so they created a small world with personality. I appreciate the fact that I won\u2019t have to invest large amount of time to experience all that this game has to offer.\n\nThe not so good\n\nThere\u2019s not much that I don\u2019t like about the game. I\u2019m very satisfied with every aspect of \u201cI am Setsuna\u201d at its core. However, the game is not perfect and there are a few things that I think could have improved the game. I consider the below points nitpicks about an otherwise great game.\n\nSetting\n\nAll of the environments I\u2019ve reached in the game so far can be described as \u201csnowy, wooded, wasteland\u201d, and I don\u2019t see this changing much for the rest of the game. While I do like the general graphics and art style and how the setting matches the tone of the story, I can only handle so much snow. I think the town and dungeon design is fine; I enjoy exploring all of the environments in the game (mainly because that means I get more time to listen to the soundtrack). However, instead of thinking \u201cNice, a new dungeon/town! Can\u2019t wait to explore it!\u201d, I find myself thinking \u201coh\u2026 another icy/snowy town/dungeon\u2026\u201d.\n\nMenus/UI theme\n\nThis complaint arises from my complaint about the setting. The main menu which is used to manage items, skills, equipment, party, etc. has a sort of \u201cgray, arctic\u201d theme. This is fine, looks great, and the UX of the menu is pretty good. However, because most of the game takes place in a snowy environment, the menu tends to blend into the surroundings. It can be hard to navigate the menu in certain areas of the game due to the colors blending in to the background.\n\nNo Attack Range Indicators\n\nIn battle, many attacks and skills are targeted at an enemy, but affect an area around the enemy. Unfortunately, the game doesn\u2019t show you the range of the attack you are using. This means you will often be asking yourself, \u201cI\u2019m targeting enemy A, is enemy B close enough to be hit by this?\u201d and you will often be wrong. If the game were actually difficult, this would be a huge problem, but as it is, this is just a minor annoyance.",

There is void under your legs and you need to guess where you need to go, otherwise you will fall and die. But you can use your gun, so you will shoot under your legs, so you can see something at least.\n\nPlatforming.\nI don't know who decided that this will be a great idea. There will be places, where you cannot see anything. And you will need to jump from one platform to other.\nYes, you have a flashlight, but it cannot be always active.\nProtagonist's jumping feels kinda \"off\". In other games you can feel where are you jumping, but in Forgive me Father you just cannot normally calculate where you will land.\n\nYou can be easily shooted down, if you will stay under open fire.\nGame models are 2D, and if you will stand to your enemies in 90 degree - it's very hard to see them.\nBy the same reason - you cannot see some projectiles and particles, so in really deep combat you cannot evade them.\n\nLeveling up and abilities.\nI thinks it's always best to start with Experience Upgrade.\nBut there so many non-obvious with Weapon Upgrades and you cannot rollback your decisions.\nSome upgrades are changing type of ammo, so you need to be careful and plan everything at first steps.\n\nMusic is really great in Forgive me Father.\nComic style adds some style and unique feeling.",

I will definitely check out other games by this developer.",

So big part of me enjoying the game is to be in Blacksad's world.\nAs for the gameplay part, it is painful. Controls are unresponsive and clumsy and most of the time it is pain to just move the character around. Camera is not helping either, I guess it was supposed to help the \"comic feel\", but it killed the gaming part. Another annoying things are times for everything, most of the time absolutely unnecessary. A lot of times I had to choose response in dialog without managing to even read all the possibilities. And lastly, a lot of choices are just illusion of choice because either they have no impact on the story or all other choices but one lead to your death...\n\nSummary:\nAs a game is Blacksad not really good and if you are not fans of the theme and style (anthropomorphic noir detective story) or original comic, stay away. But for those who do, it is definitely worth playing for the story.",

It starts you off as a spaceship crash survivor with only a pickaxe with which to explore its randomly generated 2D planets, but stick with it long enough and you can build all the way up to fighting aliens with tanks and creating manufacturing megastructures in seconds with a personal robot swarm. While it gets a little slow in certain places and its ultra-complex logistics chains can be overwhelming, the rewarding depth that can be extracted from its whirring conveyor belts and steam-belching power plants are worth the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to understand about Factorio is that it's one of those games you probably won't figure out how to play optimally through trial and error alone. My first couple of experimental factories ended up being such a mess that I decided it was better to simply abandon them and start over rather than trying to salvage the tangle of assembly lines and mining drills I had created before I understood some key tricks and common pitfalls. You\u2019re best off doing your homework and reading wikis and watching tutorial videos, or bringing along a friend who knows what they're doing in multiplayer, because Factorio won\u2019t guide you away from frustrating disaster.",

While plenty of casuals may not know this series, gaming itself has been shaped by this series as far back as 1985. Even now, we still see games influenced by it: some are pretty good, some not so much. And yet, Arthur is still king.\n\nOver 30 years of tearing apart Ghouls, Ghosts, Goblins, and everything in between show that he's no slouch, and Resurrection is further proof of that. The magic system has been reworked for the better, and there's plenty of passive skills to make the journey easier. Ironically, you don't need any of that to even beat the game.\n\nNo amount of level-ups or power-ups can replace your skill and the power of your two thumbs. That's gaming at its core. It's what distinguishes it from books, music, TV, and movies. Even if you watch someone else succeed in a game, it won't ever match the high you get when you do it yourself. It's an inherently masochistic medium that makes you work for your enjoyment. It's not the princess that keeps you going, not world peace, not even a high score. It's the thrill of conquering. It's what separates the casuals from the hardcore. No matter how many times you lose, you keep going until (YOU) win. And in this game, you will lose. A lot.",

          "content": "Survival games nowadays consists of plots involving a zombie apocolypse or an extraterrestrial threat, or mutants and monsters from the fallout of a nuclear war. Developers go pretty imaginative when it comes to the threats a player confronts in their games, when in reality the most thrilling challenges come from those that are real. That's where The Long Dark excels, as it takes you into a fictional world that feels very real in both the challenges you will face combined with the vicarious connection you instantly find yourself having with your character.\n\nWhen the game first came out, the Story Mode known as Wintermute wasn't available at that time, since then Hinterland has released 3 of the 5 chapters and plan on releasing the 4th by the end of 2020 (delays have taken place due to Covid, mentioned in the Dev Diary). This review is based on Survival Mode. In this mode, the mission is to survive as long as possible. There is no hand holding, no objectives or quests, just your character and a setting that will test your skills to live. What we find out is that your character survived a plane crash and is now lost somewhere in Northern Canada known as Great Bear Island. A once small thriving community spread throughout the island, we now find it to be mysteriously abandoned for the most part, every once in a while finding an unfortunate soul who succumbed to the elements that now engulf the region. Modern amenities like electricity, heat, and running water have all seem to stop functioning as well, with the rare short occurances of the Aurora Borealis inexplicably \"spark\" (no pun intended) life albiet it slightly to a few aplliances and utilities for a short while, almost as a haunting reminder of what the world was just before your accident, teasing you for a small moment as it disappears alongside the Northern Lights. And with the absence of humankind, the wilderness thrives once more, as the wildlife expand their boundaries to what are now the ruins of their human neighbors. What would seem a simple search for food supplies in an abandoned town for instance can immediately become dangerous as you run into a pack of wolves, or a bear, who are also looking for their next meal. Or when canned foods and rations run out, do you decide to turn into a predator yourself, as you hunt for deer or rabbits, or hope to catch fish. All this taking place during one of the worst blizzards faced in the region, where hypothermia becomes a common risk on an almost daily basis. Not to mention at times, your own body might decide to go against you by becoming ill, or injured, or tired. Even in the comforts of finding shelter, you have the risk of getting \"Cabin Fever\" if you stay indoors for too long, where the only remedy is to confront the elements once more. This game does a superb job taking into account a variety of dangers both obvious and unexpected, and placing you smack dab in the middle of it all, with no remorse nor guidance. This is Survival afterall, what more do you need to know other than do whatever it takes to do just that....survive.\n\nIn my numerous playthroughs of the game, my character has died in various of ways to the point I've made a long list of each one, since they are all mostly unique and rarely the same way. Where I learn from my mistakes, I'm bound to make more, or in some cases the game leaves no other choice but to fall into \"The Long Dark.\" And yet never do I feel like I want to \"rage quit,\" or give up on this game. It leaves me wanting to start a new session and hope I last longer. And the key word there is hope, because there's always a sense of hope, even if it might be false, you hope that the next region is filled with supplies, hope that the blizzard dies down, hope that the wolves have dispersed from outside your shelter, hope that the next day is a good day. There is no end game, no getting off the island, no rescue team coming for you, you will eventually one way or the other succumb to \"The Long Dark.\" And yet finding the resemblence of hope in the form of a place, an item, a skill learned, in just plain luck, that hope drives you to keep going. Now whether its taking you faster or slower towards the inevitable, thats doesnt matter, it's the experience throughout the journey, as lonesome and dire as it might seem at times, that you are willing to overcome.\n\nI might have digressed a bit into what this review should also describe, it's just I really admire and enjoy this game so much. So with that in mind, let us talk about the mechanics and techinical aspect of the game. The graphics of the game might take you away from the reality it tries to incorporate. It seems at times it resembles a TellTale game the way the world is drawn. Not that it takes away from it too much, you definitely forget about it instantly, but don't go expecting advanced motion capture and realistic 3D rendering. For instance, whenever you come across human remains, its in one of two positions,  and theres no details or resemblence of this once being a living person, it just seems like a husk. Or maybe looking around houses and seeing the portraits and paintings on the wall, they are all blurry and not interesting. Not that they should be of course, but I think there would be more of a sense of eerie-ness seeing these smiling faces in a potrait staring at you as you scavenge through their property. At times you might come across a book bag that you search through for supplies and items, yet you can't pick it up and use it, as your character needs to balance item capacity carry. There is an item that you can craft that is a satchel of sorts, but if the game is already showing me that there are carrying bags in the game that I can interact with, one would imagine your character would pick it up and use it themselves. There are also mechanics that are a bit annoying, for instance your character can not jump. I might come across a small platform or dock or rock or some sort of slightly elevated foundation/obstacle in front of the character and would in no ways hold you back or detour you in real life, and yet in the game you need to go around. There are glass freezers you will find in gas stations that sometimes contain soda cans and water, yet the doors to them slightly open enough to maybe squeeze a hand in, becoming at times a mission to select the items inside with your mouse (or controller). In reality you would imagine being able to fully swing open the door, or break the glass as to take the much needed content inside them. There are a few other items I could nitpick on, but none of them affect me enough to not love this game.\n\nThe Long Dark continues to add content and updates, as well as Hinterland Studios being very open and communicative with the community, so the game still has plenty of potential patches and additions to be brought into the game. That's great to know in a game where the replayability value is immense. I love this game, and I imagine it might show in my review here. And although taste is subjective, I know this is a game that I could recommend to the most competitive of gamers, all the way to someone who hardly plays videogames. The Long Dark is available for PC/Playstation/XBox/and soon Switch.",

          "content": "I was itching for a survivor genre game and decided to give a chance to The Long Dark. \r\n\r\nAt first, I was skeptical because the visuals are very simplistic. But the gameplay is so immersive, I got addicted to it, and I started to like landscapes too and found the interiors comforting and relaxing. I didn't mind that animations are stiff and unrealistic, that textures are muddy, and despite what you are wearing, your hands stay in the same cloths. \r\n\r\nIf you are playing on a hard mode, the game hits you hard, and you have to prioritize things to survive.  Every task needs a specific time, so you have to manage your time correctly because if you waste your time, you waste your food and water. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I started this game on easy mode, because I had no idea how to play it, and progressed through the story. I ended up with so many recourses the game became too easy to be fun, and I could not change the difficulty in the mid-game. The story is not the strongest part of this game, so I didn't want to start it over, and I gave up on it. Instead, I started survival mode. I got addicted to it, but since there is no story in survival mode at some point, it becomes repetitive and you have a feeling that you don't achieve anything. So I stopped playing and hope to start over the story mode after some time.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that I didn't like was a lot of walking, which becomes boring even in games with advanced graphics.\r\n\r\nOverall, despite the graphics and weak story, the game is good, because of immersive gameplay",

          "content": "But on the other hand, the game gets boring even despite its short duration of 2-4 hours, in fact, it is a typical horror-quest, we have several locations (pizzeria, house, school, etc.), each with several rooms, and we have to run back and forth, finding various \"openers\" (we have a hand-drawn inventory with key items, items for achievements and read-items), if we run for a very long time, we stumble and make a lot of noise, so along the way we sit under tables (or ventilation-fast travels), enduring Golden Freddy passing by, with the rest of the animatronics only scripted moments and self-repeating tasks for crafting baits, although there are already sound baits for distraction Yellowbear scattered across all the maps.\r\nThe plot about a parallel reality after descending into a bathtub of balls is interesting only conceptually, the prologue, for example, is very atmospheric, but all the dialogues/characters are very simple, the ending is a template for a horror, although i can't say that it's bad, there are 4 of them, which are classic for such a game, and they open quite simply.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude0a \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddef

          "content": "Machinika Museum is a puzzle game whose gameplay is very similar to \"The Room\" series -- each puzzle is an alien object you have to fix or activate. Such objects are beautifully rendered, and can be rotated at will; and rotate you will, because tons of switches, buttons and alien puzzles are all around their surfaces. The puzzles are not too hard, but do require good observation skills. There are some creative ideas there -- there are a few recurrent tools which are well designed and fun to use, including an all-purpose screwdriver which I wish existed in real life.\n\nExtra points to the rich sound design -- every action you perform is rewarded with nice clinks, clanks, buzzes, and some wonderfully mechanical \"ka-ta-chunk\" sounds, reinforcing the physicality of the experience. The music isn't memorable, but supports the mystery mood nicely too.\n\nThere is a bit of a suitable story behind your actions, which ends with a \"to be continued\" (but it does not feel too incomplete). Now, while generally the graphics are extremely nice, the very last screen is graphically underwhelming -- the story demanded a much more beautiful and detailed scene there.\n\nFinally, the game is short -- currently there are 9 objects, and the whole thing is over in about 2.5 hours. That said, there is nearly no filler here, which makes for a nice experience all around.",

It still has moments of brillance, when everything works together it feels like the best single player shooter on the market, but too many times the game forces you to play in an hyper-specific way and will punish you quickly if have a different idea. They expanded the story in all the worst ways, investing in the lore and going overboard with the self-aware humour. All that said, this is a technical powerhouse, looking great and running perfectly even on console. The basic gameplay is still very fun though, it gets the job done.",

          "content": "DOOM Eternal - 10/10\n\nAt the moment, DOOM Eternal is the best action FPS-shooter ever made. It has everything: flawless gameplay, quality graphics, astonishing level design, a decent and well-written storyline with perfectly expanded lore, and, of course, a divine soundtrack, which elevates the enjoyment of the game to the highest possible level.\n\nCompared to DOOM (2016), the gameplay has been refreshed and upgraded to the next level. Annoying flaws were fixed or adapted organically to the new gameplay features. Platforming, which allows one to behold the scale of the game, is a cool way to explore beautiful locations. Unlike the previous game, finding secrets is much more convenient, making it really hard to miss anything. The main gameplay not only remained the same but was also carefully and thoroughly improved with a variety of new features and tools for slaying hellish fiends in the most extravagant and creative ways, each time filling you with pleasure.\n\nOne more thing that still amazes me is how vast and majestic the world feels\u2014it really feels as if you are wandering between worlds: those lost and on the verge of oblivion. The magnitude of events is truly breathtaking.\n\nTo my surprise, the lore of the universe is truly deeply thought out, drawing you deeper into the action. The only issue is obtaining 95% of the information from codex pages, which can become tedious at some point. However, the breadth of the narrative is definitely worth it.\n\nThe sound design and soundtrack are at the highest possible level. Not only is the fight music amazing, raising your adrenaline to the top, but the ambient tracks are made with such passion, making you feel 100% immersed in the world you are in. Although I am not a music expert, I feel like the sound of the fighting tracks was refreshed with the addition of more electronic sounds compared to the DOOM (2016) OST, and I truly enjoy that.\n\nThe only flaw I cannot overlook is some critical bugs I've encountered. The situation is much better compared to DOOM (2016), where I was literally magically flying over the entire level or was banned by devs from passing through doors :). But in any case, some bugs are still in the game, for example, music and sound disappearance, checkpoint/level stuck. Maybe at some point it annoys, especially when you have to replay some hard encounter or slayer gate, though to be honest, in around 30 hours of gameplay, there were only 4 or 5 instances, so considering how enormous this game is, this can be overlooked.\n\nDOOM Eternal is indeed a masterpiece, and I'd definitely like to try the Extra-Life mode, or even Ultra-Nightmare someday.",

However, which specific fragments of the greater truth they will have collected by the time the game ends will differ vastly from player to player. Even if the thousands of little decisions in conversations or time-management the player has to make don't seem to matter when the plot resolves; they matter tremendously along the way. The illusion works, and the overall experience is unique.\r\n\r\nAnd that might be one of the many points Pentiment tries to make: How complex and fragmented the truth is; and how fleeting and malleable it is to the extent that it's always in danger to not really matter at all in the end. And then life just goes on. People try to forget and that's terrifying for those who care for the truth. Even phyiscal evidence in books or any other form cannot stop this collective process of erosion.\r\n\r\nThe characters and dialogues in Pentiment are realistic and alive in a down-to-earth kind of way. Some will find it boring; I found it refreshing and endearingly subtle. Love or hate for this game will hinge on that. Objectively, every theme that is touched is explored with great care and research behind it, which is immensely satisfying. Pentiment really sells the illusion of talking to real people in the 16th century and the gameplay is defined by trying to get information out of people by interpreting their social norms and guessing what they like to hear.",

          "content": "The roleplaying mechanics are dialed back a bit from other Obsidian games but its still pretty effective here. You can pick things like where Andreas (the main characer) studied and what he studied. I picked Law and Occult studies, and it made for an interesting combination. Both skills came up quite often in conversation and were very handy when I was investigating leads. When talking to characters sometimes when you make dialogue choices the game will pop up a \"This will be remembered\" message like in a Telltale game, and this basically comes up later when trying to perusade someone, as it will list a bunch of options you picked before and whether or not that person agreed with you which leads to either a successful or unsuccessful persuasion. Simple but it gets the job done. \r\n\r\nThe comparisons to Disco Elysium are fair in some cases but a bit off base in others. It definitely has that similar detective vibe of you trying to solve a murder, but otherwise its quite different. DE has a lot more systems at play and the skill checks are based on dice rolls, where as this is just a simple you either have the skill or you don't system, which I ultimately prefer. I do wish there was a leveling system similar to DE's but otherwise theres not much to complain about.\r\n\r\nThe story overall I thought was very good and well told. The first two acts had me hooked as to who the killer was and I kept feeling like I was making the wrong decisions, but in a good way. There's plenty of choice and consequence here and I love to see that in RPGs. Act 3 did drop off a bit for me in terms of my interest in the story, as your not really solving a murder but rather learning the history of the town, which I didn't find as interesting. However it does pick up towards the end and I found the twist to be very unexpected. And I thought the story wraps up nicely by the end of the game.\r\n\r\nOtherwise I don't have many complaints. The OST is very good but it only plays during certain key story moments and I would have liked it to be used more. Even just a simple town theme that would play when your running around the town would have been appreciated.",

          "content": "I currently have 38.5 hours into this game I recommend this game to anybody who wants to give racing/drifting a try also the price is not very expensive. The game is amazing at first but after a while it gets boring. You can play friends or with strangers within the online co-op to enjoy the racing/drifting together. There is a good amount of cars to earn in the catalog that it offers also notably the customization is solid to make the car to your own liking styling or performace. Lastly there is more content you can buy for such as maps or cars to explore more in. The game itself does still get updates after a while so its a nice to comeback after while just to check whats fresh",

          "content": "Super Monkey Ball: Banana Mania isn't very impressive. The game is fundamentally the same as previous entries in the series, which is fine since the core physics and movement is pretty tight. Besides that, Banana Mania doesn't have a whole lot going for it.\n\nThe campaign mode varies significantly in quality between levels. On one level, you might beat it first try in 20 seconds, but on the next you might get stuck there for dozens of minutes, only for it to go back to extremely easy on the next level. The difficulty doesn't really have a natural progression to it. The first few worlds seem to be geared around the assumption that you'll go for collectables, but if you don't care about those you'll breeze right through the levels.\n\nOne of the core issues is level design, which is desperately lacking in some parts. The game is constantly throwing new mechanics at you, but doesn't seem interested in helping you actually get better at the game. Sometimes everything clicks and sometimes nothing does.\n\nOne thing that the game has going for it is the style. Music and visuals combine to make an enjoyable experience. The characters are pretty cute and make lots of noises as you play the game. I also like the little comic-book style cartoons before and after each world.\n\nOverall Score: 5/10",

Engaging enemies in tight spaces can be a clunky and cumbersome affair, detracting from the overall enjoyment. Despite this flaw, The Witcher 3's strengths in storytelling and world-building shine brightly, making it a game that lingers in the mind long after the adventure concludes.",

          "content": "LONG REVIEW (Covers main game + both expansions)\nThis game is overrated! is probably what your thoughts will be as a person who straight jumped into the 3rd Witcher game, it\u2019s a massive game, and your opinion about it would count after at least 30 hours which is almost the time to play a new game, those who feel overwhelmed by it and found it tedious will probably not wait for ~30 hours to decide. Which is unfortunate, as its only after about 30 hours that this game progresses from something that is tedious/slow/overwhelming to come show itself to be one of the most polished deep video games that's been made to date. And when I say deep I don\u2019t meant it to be very abstract in its writing, or bombarding the player with themes and theories that they couldn\u2019t have up with, in fact there is nothing very deep or unexpected in it. What it has however is a sense of scale that is unsurpassed in any video game I've ever played.\n\nThe Witcher 3 continues the story of Geralt of Rivia, a known monster slayer aka Witcher who \u2026you guessed it ..kills monster! After the events of the Witcher 1 &amp; 2 Geralt has restored his memory and now he is searching for his former partner Yennefer of Vengerberg, Geralt with Yennefer have to look for Ciri who is constantly on run and is being chased by the \"Wild Hunt\"\nThe story starts slow as Geralt wants to find Ciri his adopted daughter, the game just like its prequels consists of prologue, acts, epilogue, the prologue starts with a tutorial area called White Orchard which teaches the player about the game and introduces them to its basics, it is this part that is slow and tedious because the game didn\u2019t kick in yet, the game continues with act 1 main goal which is to find Ciri, the story may seem very simple as you have to look for a character but inside the journey Geralt will meet very complex characters and the main quests start going branching paths to side quests who are among the greatest side quests ever written in gaming. The game continues with ACT 2 and takes into the epic battle genre this time, in this act the game has lord of the rings vibes, an epic battle, which then continues on its epic scale into ACT 3, until the epilogue which can vary depending on the player decisions in the game. No matter what ending the player gets it always has something great and emotional behind it.\n\nThe story doesn\u2019t end there, after the main game CD project RED introduces an expansion (Hearts of Stone) which is a short story expansion that blew my mind at how smartly written and engaging it is, the expansions introduces one of the most cunning and mysterious villains in history of gaming, and another equally amazing character. Unlike the main game in terms of side quests the quantity is very low, as the main focus here was to tell the short story in the main quest. The expansion also added some of the best boss fights in the whole series, boss fights that were a huge step up from the main game, requiring more mechanics to beat and having more advanced pattern.\nThe story progresses afterwards to reach the second expansion (Blood and Wine) which marks the end of Geralt journey, in my opinion an expansion one of its kind, very huge area that is also very beautiful, contains some of my favorite characters in the series, the expansion starts as a murder mystery then progresses into something fairytale-like that is full of neat references to famous books and finishes with one of the most memorable boss fights I have ever had in gaming.\n\nIt has to be noticed I have not mentioned the other aspects of the game, which I will cover in short. The Gameplay itself is very good, and while the combat and controls may feel clunky at first it won't take much time to get used to them, which afterwards Geralt feels like a dancing swordsman which is what he really is (according to the books and the lore). The combat itself is fairly basic and limited (again because of the lore) and contains light/heavy attack and dodge(side-step)/Roll buttons as well as having signs (mini-magic) it has similarities to Batman combat system, however I find the combat to start getting more advanced and having more depth once the players starts going with alchemy (bombs-oils-decoctions-potions) which basically adds new abilities to the gameplay, on higher difficulties the player needs to take advantage of monsters, read about their weakness and use the Witcher tools to overcome the challenge, the gameplay progresses by increasing levels and unlocking more skills to make various builds and especially around the second expansions it adds another layer to it by adding something called mutations. There are a lot of monsters and each has interesting ideas and design behind them. The dialogue choices are impactful and then there is one of my favorite mini games ever made called Gwent, a tactical card game that is really enjoyable, I sunk many hours into it while forgetting about the quests that im doing. \n\nThe Music is Slavic inspired and feels folklorish, its simple music most of the time, not an orchestra type of music, its simple and has as Geralt says \"Nice Tune\" it contains many memorable soundtracks.\nThe voice acting is greatly done as well, there is a difference in accents between regions which strongly showcase the different cultures the game tries to portray. \n\nThe art direction is simply breathtaking, the game is very screenshot worthy, to understand this point simply go to any thread on the internet and check for Witcher 3 shots, preferably on PC high settings and the amount of details and beautiful art design is mindblowing. It looks amazing. The character cast is among my favorite, they have great distinct personalities, they have good development and backstory counting the previous games as well, some of the most complex and well written characters in gaming are presented in Witcher series, memorable cast with beautiful design and nice personality. You may notice most characters are not really good and not really bad, its shades of gray as in Witcher world there is no absolute evil or good. \n\nIn-Conclusion the game is open world story driven rpg, the main draw behind the game is its worldbuilding and writing which has main &amp; side quests and characters. The game has the other good aspects as well, but if you are into open world story driven rpg games I cannot recommend this one enough, it is a must play game and is truly among the greatest games of all time, its recommended that you at least be familiar with the prequels Witcher 1 and Witcher 2 at least, to further understand the story better and enhance your experience and immersion. \n\nThank you for Reading!",

          "content": "I ended up uninstalling the game, it is so frustrating and doesn't hold the comparison against the Elder Scrolls franchise or the Assassin Creed one.\n\nHave to say, the lore is wonderful, and its open world is huge. Geralt is certainly badass, and there's loads of content (Bestiary, NPCs, Gwent, sidequests etc.)\n\nIssue I have is it's LONG. not long as \"Ah i'm so glad i am going to have 300 hours of unlimited fun\", but long as \"I need to go from point A to point B for a quest, by the time i finish the quest I will have spent 30 minutes, whilst the boss fight itself will take 2 minutes at best\".\n\nAlso, had some bugs that I saw are shared with other players, where the game is bugged with the gamma and appears extremely dark, to the point you cannot see in dark environment (despite having a torch lit). This can be ultimately solved by manually editing some config files of the games but it's annoying.\n\nFinally - and that's what made me cringe most - geralt and/or his horse must have some rare handicap where they are blocked any time there's a small obstacle in front of them that even a dwarf could walk onto. So you might be running wit your horse and suddenly it stops. Because of the angle of the camera you wouldn't even see the obstacle.\n\ngood game overall, especially if you're a fan of the Witcher saga, but sorry I will go back to Skyrim or Assassin Creed",

Since the beginning of the story in White Orchard to the lush fields of Toussaint found in the DLC, this game has changed me. I would highly recommend this game to those who enjoy playing a game for the story and taking the time to immerse yourself in this world created by CD Project Red.\n\nJust a warning, this game is very very long. If you plan on completing all the quests for the DLC and base game, you should expect to play over 100 hours. This isn't a personal problem for me, if anything you know that you will be getting your money's worth. (especially when the complete edition of the game goes on sale for $15) Although, the main story is a monster to complete and I know that can be a turn off for some people.\n\nSide quests feel well written, almost as good as the main quests, if not better. They just add another layer to this dozen layer wedding cake of a game, baked with care and love. The only part I wasn't a fan of was Gwent. Gwent is a minigame found throughout the entire game that provides more play time, extra quests, and even alternate decisions in quests. Thankfully, Gwent is never mandatory to play, although I felt forced to play it as a 'completionist' to 100% the game.\n\nOverall, if you are debating on playing this game or not... play it. It is worth all the time and energy spent. Like I said earlier, this is a big recommendation to those who enjoy experiencing long and rich stories. \n",

For those interested in trying to put it together. \nIt took me around 5 hours to complete and find everything in the game on Steam.\n\nThe goal of the game is to collect all the pearls in a level using the indicated number of moves, though you can go over that number and continue to progress. There is also a jewel hidden in each level, which can be a puzzle of their own due to the steps needed to access some spots.\nThe main game has 84 levels that are split across 7 shelves by year, each shelf has 3 pictures and each picture has a set of 4 levels. New mechanics are introduced on almost every shelf with the difficulty increasing through mechanic interactions and the number of moves required to complete levels.\nThere is a hint system in the game that I didn't interact with, from what I remember it apparently gives a hint for the first token used then shows you the intended puzzle solution for the movement number indicated. \n\nSome levels can be completed in less moves than indicated because of specific mechanic interactions. These small skips mainly matter for the leaderboards that ranks that amount of moves used on each shelf of puzzles. The global leaderboards do have some cheaters listed with impossible scores but it can still be satisfying to see your rank with a group of others that found a skip or simply finished a shelf of puzzles perfectly. There is also an option to compare scores against friends on Steam.",

It makes sense from a story-telling perspective, but you being the character and repeating these steps is just tedious. I had to find a walk-through after a couple of hours because I was interested in the story, but I just did not want to play it anymore.

You must visit these broken-up islands, eliminate the enemies that attack you, and collect shards of power so that you can provide power to a large structure called \"The Bastion,\" which becomes your player's home base. It also becomes the only safe haven, as well as the player's space for new buildings that can be built, which allow many different bonuses, utilities, and also some options that can provide different challenges.\r\n\r\nThe game's currency, fragments, can be used to purchase upgrades, make buildings, and improve weapons. Gaining experience also boosts the player's stats and gives them more health. Throughout the game, there are various weapons that you can collect, although you can only have two equipped at a time. You can also equip a special attack, and there are quite a few different types in the game. Enemies drop potions, that, when drunk, can restore some health or give you the special items needed in order for you to use your special attack moves. In order to change your weapons, you must use an arsenal at The Bastion.\r\n\r\nYou'll often find structures and ruins, and places where life suddenly stopped; when The Calamity hit. You will come across many fun and challenging areas, as well as challenges that reward you with EXP and with other items.",

          "content": "Blades of Time is primarily a hack-and-slash game (attack, block, slide out of the way, jump for different attacks), but there are many interesting mechanics which add tons of variety to the game:\n\n* Once you get enough \"rage\" by hitting enemies, you can unleash a variety of spell-like abilities (fire spells, freezing spells, heavy strikes, sliding attacks); all of these are satisfying to unleash and the interface with the controller is well thought out and easy to remember.\n* There is a \"Time Rewind\" skill. This can be used to solve a few light puzzles, but, more importantly, it can be used in combat as well. This makes for some exciting fights, where multiples copies of you are casting, shooting and hacking at an enemy (and some enemies must be attacked from multiple angles at the same time);\n* Yes, shooting, because the game also has a few rifles, and their mechanics is surprisingly smooth and satisfying, meshing well with the other game systems, even with a controller.\n* And there is a little bit of other stuff which is better left to be discovered (use of light and shadows in a particularly interesting level, a few uses of an \"order\" spell, some other cool movement options).\n\nThe plot is not groundbreaking, but it is interesting enough, and it adds to the gameplay -- in the second half of the game, there are rivaling factions, and you often see your enemies fighting each other, which adds more chaos and action to the scenes. The dialogues aren't Shakespearean, but are well written enough, and the voice acting is also good enough.\n\nAlso, the graphics aren't exactly technically groundbreaking, even for a 2012 game -- models are blocky, textures aren't too sharp... But artistically, I found them very appealing; the surroundings evoke mysterious and alien architectures and are very pleasant to look at. The bigger spell effects feel particularly \"punchy\"; when many of your copies perform a big spell simultaneously, it is even hard to see what is going on... but it still looks super cool. And the animations are well done, the whole game feels very responsive and smooth as a consequence.\n\nFinally, there is this \"Outbreak\" mode, which is a very light MOBA mode (think \"simplified League of Legends\") but with the mechanics of the single player game (except Time Rewind). I played a few single-player rounds with it and had fun, but did not really dabble in any MP with it.\n\nAll in all, this is an awesome underrated gem. Score: 86/100.",

All that good stuff.\n-Gameplay feels solid. UI is good, mechanics are there and do not fall apart.\n-Katarina =)\ncons:\n-Out of 3 classes of heroes - 2 are locked away in DLC. That's just a dick move really.\n-Simplicity of it's core. Zero build diversity, while you have to appoint attributes and skills - it's pretty much useless, you might as well had them auto-allocated. Action is not as good and diverse as in Diablo 3, systems behind the game are not as deep and complex as in Path of Exile.\n\nI will definitely finish the game, because it grabbed me in some way, but I really couldn't recommend to buy this game, as it seems like a easily skippable one.",

          "content": "Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed this part of the experience, as well as the wholesome chunky graphics. But the rest of the game is pretty... meh? It's really, and I mean REALLY, slow. Even your character moves slowly without any sprint button, which is especially noticeable in locations like apartments or an arcade, where you need to get up the stairs or up and down on an elevator. And there is no beautiful scenery that you need to slowly enjoy. You manually slowly move your camera, because things like doors or characters are usually somewhere offscreen or behind another object. And when camera moved by itself (like during or after the cutscenes), it made me motion sick. For you to slowly change the location tile you need to be outside and in the starting point of that location. Which means that in an arcade, for example, you need to get back to the other side of the second floor, click on the elevator, wait to go down, run through the whole room to the door, click on it, wait and only then go through the tiles, probably accidentally skipping the one you need. In the park you can't open your tiles even if you are in the OUTSIDE PART of the hideout, you need specifically be near the playground. Most of the quests are either \"go to the other side of the room, say this to that character and then go back to me so we can repeat that process\" or \"exit 3 rooms, go to that tile, run to the end of it, get into the building, find that thing and backtrack all the way back to me, only for me to give you another quest IN THE SAME PLACE YOU WERE IN BEFORE SPENDING 3 MINUTES TO RUN BACK\". And I'm not even talking about side quests, where you need to talk to some character, whose name you don't remember at all, so you need to run around, talking to everyone and just hoping one of them will be some kind of blended together in your head spice or herb name that you need. I originally thought that this game is just a bunch of minigames or arcades, where you challenge characters on rock-paper-scissors and things like that. But it's not. In the end there are only 3 and a half minigames: rhythm-game, race, lemonade stand and a main one about fighting and collecting more fruits then another team. None of them are particularly good. Rhythm-game is really clunky, so I, as a vivid rhythm-games enjoyer, didn't beat even a first opponent and gave up on that one. All races are held on the same exact map that you will get tired of on the third lap. They are boring and really easy, especially as soon as you realize that you can just hold a speed up button and constantly drift from side to side. Lemonade stand is whatever, it gets repetitive really fast, so I actually played it like 1-2 times. And a competitive game is pretty unfair: your teammate's AI is stupid and ruin half of the matches, while the opponent team is always together and just ambush you 4 on 1 when you are running to the blender. Controls in this minigame are clunky, you often miss and even if not you still barely deal any damage. It's always held on the same map with the same fruit placements and the same team sides (except 1 time), so it's not really challenging and still is boring. Dragging through those minigames to get buttons is a chore. I've encountered a lot of softlocking and regular bugs, that forced me to alt + f4 the game and lose my latest progress. Every time when I closed the game and opened it again it was on 0% volume for some reason and my accessories were taken off. I still 100% the game and the story about childhood adventures is something I personally really enjoy in my media, so I guess it says something.",

          "content": "Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night Review\nBy:\nWanderingoff\nIf you are looking for a game that can bring you a challenge and a lot of exploring this game will be for you. When playing this game you will find yourself lost more than once and wonder what you need to do in order to get to the next part. Sure that can be annoying and very frustrating. Let me just say this the game will give you an amazing experience in your first completely blind playthrough of it. The gameplay will have you excited to figure out the map and with a few patients and poking your nose around every nook and cranny you will finally figure it out. Personally, for me, I would get completely stuck with no idea of what to do so I would spend time running through it all again and again just to see what I may have missed or if something I did finally unlocked a different part. The good about this was that I would get to kill monsters over and over-collecting shards and then selling them. As I said earlier that can be rather frustrating and even annoying. Yet for some reason the way this game is designed it really did make it so it didn't actually get too frustrating.\nThe gameplay itself is simply fantastic and yes normal can be a great challenge. There are two other difficulties Hard and Nightmare. At the time of writing this, I am currently working on my hard run. I really want to jump into Nightmare and see what it is like although in order to do so hard must be beaten. Now don't get me wrong I am thoroughly enjoying my playthrough on hard. Something about this game though just makes me want to find out what Nightmare is actually like. I am guessing pretty brutal.\nI must say this that the excitement for the game became even more real when I got the first boss on hard. Something was a little different than what it was like on normal. Now to me, this makes it epic. I really enjoy the fact they added something. We get to a boss expecting the same fight and don't think much of it at all no matter what difficulty setting we have it on. Because low and behold we have already beaten it once so we know what to expect. Well to throw a wrench in things on thing got added and changed the entire boss challenge completely. This is why I am even more excited about this game.\nThe first boss encounter for me on Normal, die okay well I can get that die, and then beat it. First boss encounter for me wtf??? DIE, level up, DIE, LEVEL UP, DIE, I'm never gonna get this boss what do I do. A few hours later oh hey if I do this it will help me not to DIE. Finally, at level 13 I was able to defeat the boss. I will say this for the first few times of attempting it I did get frustrated because I had no idea what I could do. So I ended up logging out of the game. A few hours later I got back into and went to work with a bit of patients and just watching the moves that were happening I was finally able to figure out how and what I needed to do. In all honsesty, I almost didn't think I was going to get through it. You can see the result of the fight here:\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/DepressedPiliableCobblerCopyThis \nOnly if you wish to. I strongly suggest that the best experience that can be had is for you to do your first playthrough on normal. Then do a playthrough on hard and get to see the change for yourself. It was great for me because I had absolutely no idea there was going to be anything shocking to expect. I do not mean to spoil it for you and the reason for the clip is because well yes I am very proud that I managed to beat the boss. With all of that said the game is so much fun you can find many ways to go about playing it. There are a great variety of choices as far as weapons and shards to use. Test them out and find which is the way that fits your play style. \nBloodstained: Ritual of the Night has many reasons to play through it again. Apparently, there is a New Game Plus option after beating the game. I just barely learned about this a few days into my hard run and after beating it on normal. The thing is it can actually be something you miss entirely if you don't know there actually is a New Game Plus option. I missed it completely and so yes I am doing a clean run on hard with no benefits from the new game plus. In that aspect, it can be very easy to miss if you don't look for it.\nMy reactions while playing through this game have really been exciting while entering a boss battle or even just trying to get through a hallway. Lol, there is so much damage that could be avoided altogether easily right... I eat every single thing an enemy throws at me really it's not funny yet I just can't help but laugh knowing some of the hits I eat are completely dodgeable.\nThere is so much about this game that just makes me enjoy playing it. The developers just went out of their way to make the game epic and it is greatly appreciated. It will be a game I will play many more times without a second thought.\nNow the characters in this game I don't really know that I like them per se. It isn't really about getting to know them though it is more about okay go do this and that and win the game. The quests should have been picked up all at the same time with one click. Rather than click five million times to collect each quest while hearing the same phrase over and over again. Sure the quests are worth doing but in away after you see what happens when you first receive them it is a little too plain and really boring. That is probably one of my biggest issues with the game in all and I got over it.\nAs far as the story goes it was short and easily skippable so for me I didn't really pay attention at all to what was going on. I just went and killed things, collected shards, got lost, died and restarted areas multiple times. There is much more to say about this game and well I am waiting to get to start playing on Nightmare to be able to say a lot more about it.\nValue Of Game worth $39.99 Yes\nStory is Not Applicable\nCharacters fitting into Game Yes\nBalanced Yes\nGraphics Fantastic\nI hope that you enjoyed my review of Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.\nWanderingoff",

Also about the opponents, yes, the crowds of mindless aliens look a little awkward, but in principle it's funny and looks like an interesting skin-addon from the l4d2 workshop) The gameplay mechanics with the construction of walls are also not so bad, you can play with friends, even despite the fact that I spent about 25$ to play with four friends, I don\u2019t mind, 1. attempts to make good atmosphere, 2. modern graphics, 3. normal impact from shooting 4. The last levels took place in hazmat suits (The authors even tried in some kind of story). In general, the game turns out to be some kind of not very intelligible craft, a test one, I won\u2019t be surprised if this is the first game of the studio, but it doesn\u2019t cost very much, and I think you can buy it, because it\u2019s still another opportunity to plunge into l4d- similar cooperative gameplay in modern graphics, this was enough for me to quench at least a fraction of my thirst for Left 4 Dead 3) and compared to the previous attempt to create a new left4dead \"Revelation 2012\" by third-party developers, it already looks a little better. And for attempts in the field of atmosphere and plot, at least an attempt, I will never raise my hand to dislike the game and hate the authors, thanks haters, we got an absolutely plotless and atmosphereless \"Back 4 Blood\". Left 4 Dead never had enough story.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curator`s page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

Though short, this is now in my \"Top 10 Puzzlers\" of all-time, next to \"The Sexy Brutale\" and heavy-weight \"The Talos Principle\", to give an idea of how much I enjoyed it.\n\nSolving a puzzle here feels like cheating on a Stealth-Action game; the main mechanics is that you can rewind or forward time at will, so you can time narrow escapes perfectly. Once you solve a level, you can then watch the action unfold in real time, and it looks really cool, with all those impressive moves you carefully built. This might sound repetitive (there is a lot of trial and error for your timings if you want to solve a level in a time-efficient way), but the well thought-out interface makes it very easy to advance or rewind a few frames at a time until you get it just right.\n\nAlso, the puzzles had a perfect difficulty level for me -- they had me thinking hard at times, and every so often I needed a new idea, but I never had to look up solutions of anything. The story is only hinted at, but has a few well done dramatic moments.\n\nFinally, I thought the last few puzzles to be brilliant -- they caught me off-guard, but adapting to the new challenges made up for great playing moments, the kind you want to tell other people about.\n\nScore: 88/100.",

I've always been a sucker for JRPGs, and their battle system reminds me of Final Fantasy (in a cartoonish way of course). The map is fun to explore, and it's nice to visit places and homes and stuff. There's a bunch of side quests, which makes it easy to go at your own pace and \"explore\" if you want (although the map isn't that huge). I'm really a fan of those games.",

In every pass, the game managed to surprise me with the skills of its creators. Sound effects, music, characters, textures, puzzles, VO performances, environment, puns! \nIt was like living in Nightmare Before Christmas for a while. And they made it a pretty original way, you can feel the inspiration but it's blended in with their unique approach. \nText-based puzzles (like \"rhyme battle\" with Royam) were in my favorite moments. This kind of footwork and their sharp sense of humor reminds me of the good old adventure games. I definitely demand more! &lt;3\nEvery phase of it made me say \"ah how creators loved this game\" You can feel it. Yes! It has flaws. Some control problems, some pace issues of the flow, some unvoiced moments of the main character (Even) can take you away from the zone... But everytime like that, i said \"i wish they had more time and money\" because they definitely can create amazing things with the opportunities of the mainstream has... For the first time in my life, I wanted to congratulate EA Games to support this beauty.\n\nIf you are not a big fan of grotesque as mine you can make it 1-2 stars less. But it won't change the fact of how beautiful this game is &lt;3 \n\nI finished it, and i know I'll be back someday to feel it again.\n\nP.S. So hard to save your skin from the hands of Kiss em before you toss em. Wonderful song! \n\nP.S.2 Slim: My English is not enough to write a compliment in this complexity, but i hope you understand.\n",

          "content": "But TMNTU also stands out for its fairly good, smooth combat mechanic, a fairly diverse number of techniques, combinations, rolls that you want to repeat over and over again, \"AHEARTFULOFGAMES\" was hired for the development, responsible for a tiny indie beatemup, and apparently they approached the matter with all their heart, if you play some old projects about the carriers of the shells of the 2000s or even 2010s - all the mechanics there were much more crooked than in \"Mutants Unleashed\", believe me,\nAlso here Arenas and transitions between them use platforming, but it's too little to make a revolution in the genre, and somewhere it's inconvenient because of the fixed camera, if you're hoping for a full-fledged level like Tony Hawk with sliding along the railings, then, alas, all the maps are small boxes, and btw with a lot of backtracking, but this isn`t particularly noticeable, since the beginning and end of the map often change places,\nIn short, my main thought about the game is that the combat system is literally constricted here, the target audience for the publisher is children, so they left no chance to reveal the potential, the enemies are too easy, so much so that you will get rank S in 99.9% of cases, without even having time to warm up your fingers, there is, of course, a small progressionespecially when mobs that shoot lasers appear, but you are unlikely to endure 5 tedious hours for the sake of a little difficulty at the end. Even with the bosses, things are uneven, the first one is very difficult, and the last one is click-killing in a minute, in terms of mechanics it's standard dodges from circular damage and a lot of hp, nothing special,\nAnd in short.. there's another fundamental problem: someone came up with the idea to stretch such a simple game, putting it in the shell of some Japan-RPG.. Like time after time we have to start missions from our sewer hub, or before the task go to the gym or office.. like a place where our friends are waiting for us, which opens up a new level of upgrades for one of the turtles just for dialogues, like in a visual novel ) And here there is also a day and night system and restrictions on completion by days. There are a couple more things like in the arcade you can take a modifier for 1 run to increase damage or for additional life (when you die, you return to the map), you can go through optional missions to find infected enemies.. which then for some reason will open up infected everywhere. There is also a pizzeria, where several unsuccessful platform levels for speed are available, and at home there are dojo challenges.. damn, there is also a smartphone there, you can read notes with it and scan the area for some goodies that are not used anywhere, as well as coins and cassettes, found on the main levels - In general, all this is so unnecessary, it kills the pace of the fighting game if anyone forgot..\nThese cutscenes-dialogues about nothing with anthropomorphic animals from films begin to seem endless, fortunately they add the ability to skip them, but even so, the soul is exhausted by the minute-long loading between 3-minute levels. The content of the story also doesn`t affect the films, there everything is at the level of experiences of secondary characters like Bebop and Rocksteady disappointed in people, became bad, but we convinced them and \"changed their shoes\".. well, and some villain scientist spreads a virus at the end.. and I won't remind you about cheap animations, everything is clear here,\nAnd with aaall this, the game is not without the usual bugs, the most critical - because of which I cannot recommend the Cooperative game mode for 2 players (for which the camera is not adapted) - this is if you cross the checkpoint script before your friend, then you will immediately be separated by an invisible wall, because of which you will have to go back in order to then go forward together, and the passage back will again be frozen by the \"wall\" - who did this for what reason..\n\n\ud83d\ude0a \ud835\udde6\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddef \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddfc \ud835\uddfa\ud835\ude06

          "content": "The horrible Deponia series will not go away. Even after concluding its trilogy with a fairly final ending, somehow the repulsive Rufus is back once more in Deponia Doomsday  to insult, demean and spoil your time. \n\nWhat a wretched turd of a game. The previous Deponia trilogy was an unpleasant point-and-click graphic adventure series of almost impressively diminishing returns, that descended ever further into embarrassing, tawdry, sexist and arguably racist crap. It\u2019s a story about an unpleasant arsehole called Rufus, who lives on a trash planet that\u2019s about to be destroyed, and dreams of reaching the idyllic floating city of Elysium. The three games ended on a purportedly unhappy ending that saw Rufus falling to his apparent death. Hard to find that particularly unhappy after suffering through three games with the repellent shit, but that\u2019s the background to this fourth entry.\n\nRufus wakes up and realises that the tales of his being some sort of clone, of working alongside two of his identical-looking nemeses, and of having a girlfriend literally called \u201cGoal\u201d who has a reprogrammable brain implant he programs to remove all the \u201cbitch\u201d from her personality, were all apparently a dream, or at least a vision of the future. This, sadly, includes his eventual faux-noble sacrifice.\n\nOnce he\u2019s come to terms with all of that, a time traveller shows up and breaks Rufus\u2019s original inexplicable girlfriend Toni\u2019s crystal glass collection. The entire first act of the game is spent agonisingly repeating the same humourless or outright repulsive sequences and collecting the same inventory objects as you are forced to reverse time (at least) twice to find a way to prevent the glasses getting broken. Opportunities for clever time travel gags, or Bill &amp; Ted style planning, are all ignored. Instead, you\u2019re dragged down the obviously reductive well of shite that the writers seem to find so infinitely hilarious.\n\nAlong the way you encounter a series of stereotypes for Rufus to insult, which leads to one particularly repellently transphobic sequence. There\u2019s a large, gruff, hairy character in a bar, who makes some remark about how, \u201cYou\u2019d see me in a pink dress before I\u2019d\u2026\u201d etc. Cue Toni kicking the shit out of him for something, and his emerging from the bar in a pink dress, wig, and awkward make-up, clutching at his groin. This, we\u2019re asked to enjoy, means she\u2019s come to realise she\u2019s a woman. But HA HA HA! She\u2019s so hairy and manly, not like a lady one bit!\n\nRufus can insult her in a series of ways, but the key one is to point out that her legs are too hairy for her to be a woman (no, really), and then, through a convoluted and ludicrous sequence of puzzles that your brain would switch off if I tried to plot out, you get her some wax in exchange for her \u201cladyshave\u201d electric razor. You know, so you can shave off the fake beard you stuck to a child\u2019s face and then got covered in bees. (On top deliberately insulting portions, the game is so astonishingly thoughtless. On encountering the very first non-white character in the game, one member of a mixed-race couple moving into a house, Rufus\u2019s only remark on looking at either is, \u201cHuh, there goes the neighbourhood.\u201d I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t meant specifically, but fuck me, how did no one flag it up as a problem?)\n\nThe resetting of the story means we get to enjoy more of the wacky back-and-forth banter between Rufus and his furious mechanic girlfriend Toni, as she accurately points out what a selfish bastard he is, and he complains about her \u201cnagging\u201d. But then\u2026 mother-in-law jokes! Her mother is fat like an elephant is fat! She\u2019s a \u201charpy\u201d! She\u2019s so fat she couldn\u2019t break bones from a long fall! It\u2019s like being trapped inside a 1970s sitcom hell. You\u2019d have to really stretch a muscle to be offended by any of it, because it\u2019s so pathetic. The only rational reaction is to feel sorry for it. To feel sorry for people who find this the height of wit.\n\nIt might be possible to see all of that as an annoyance if the game underneath were solid. But continuing the downward spiral for the series, the puzzles are increasingly ridiculous and dependent upon random stumbling. You need a band to play a song, but a man nearby doesn\u2019t want them to. So of course you need the underwire from the bra of our trans friend (to improve her bust, apparently), and a potato that then needs to be chopped in half, and you have to think, \u201cI know, I\u2019ll combine a chopped in half potato with some bra underwire, and that will make a pair of earmuffs.\u201d\n\nOr, as is obviously going to be the case for anyone other than the designer of the puzzle, you\u2019re going to randomly click objects in your inventory together until something combines, and then stare at the screen with your mouth hanging slack that this exists in the universe. There\u2019s no attempt to flag if you\u2019re doing the right thing at the wrong time (which could be too early or too late given the time travel and, no hinting that you might need to make one irrational leap to succeed at another irrational leap you\u2019re currently trying to make. No structure, no thought at all put into how a player is going to encounter such entirely random situations.\n\nEvery scene, despite being lusciously drawn and animated, is barren of things to do. Highlighting interactive objects is necessary because there are so incredibly few of them in busy backgrounds, usually only two or three things in any screen. It certainly reduces the time it takes to click everything on everything, but makes it no less tedious.\n\nA puzzle in which you must create a red bar for a colourful xylophone, by, er, pulling a key from a piano with a pair of pliers, then putting the piano key through a machine that adds sausage skin to objects, then stealing a heating lamp and placing it somewhere else, then holding the key-wrapped-in-skin up to the lamp to turn it red. Despite being a piano key wrapped in cooked skin, it works perfectly well on a xylophone. Yup. That\u2019s really the level we\u2019re working at here. \n\nClearly the Deponia series is loved by enough people for them to keep making more of them, so I\u2019m sure this will be as gleefully received as the rest. But it\u2019s a nasty, stupid, and most damningly of all, badly constructed adventure game. The animations and art are lovely as ever, the music\u2019s great, most of the voice actors are decent enough, but good grief, please, no more. Just make it stop.",

          "content": "Forwarning: I was not a fan of the direction of Breath of the Wild. I'm sure this will circle the review in a more understandable light.\n\nTears of the kingdom is a direct sequel to Breath of the Wild. Whilst Breath of the Wild wasn't my ideal direction for the series, and I found a number of decisions questionable, for the most part many of these decisions were replicated in the came, and in most cases, the decisions were double-downed on. With the caveat of one which is that the game, still very open, gives more direction, with the main hub of the game. However, the durability system are addended to to make the durability feel even more lingering. On top of this, they add the new(?) throwable item system. which sounds great until you realize how stupid the controls are hold R, then hold up, then swipe the R analog to select the item, release up, and aim. Not too bad for an uncommon use but when you are using an item every ten steps in the depths. this can lead to some dexterous frustration.\n\nThe new mechanics craft and fuse. Really hinder the momentum of the game, craft forcing you to create designs for a couple of minutes, which you will usually use for 5-30 seconds, does not feel rewarding, especially given the further focus on air travel and it's increased utility. Fuse ends up increasing the complexity of the macro-management of weapons, scrolling through your weapons to diagnose which weapon could use the power boost for it's limited use. Recall and Ascend on the other hand feel like lazy design solutions, and trivialize much exploration of the sky and most importantly, the shrines. \n\nShrines make a return and although there is a fair defense of bite-sized puzzles for breath of the wild. Shrines fall to even worse heights. Of the 90 or so shrines I faced It felt like 70 of them fell into either mechanic tutorials such as how to hit a headshot, or Zonai device tutorials, such as how to use a fan, or my favorite of the three, the 'I can just use recall and I'm not sure if that's the goal' shrines which feel incredibly unrewarding, not even realizing if I solved the puzzle. The dungeons of the game feel a little underwhelming and are realistically on par with those found in BotW with a nicer coat of paint.\n\nNow onto some good parts and why despite this, I may enjoy the game a bit more then in BotW. First of all, the locations feel more friendly and active. This is due to the benefit of being a sequel but I don't hold that against them. The music also sounded better, I'm not sure if it was mixed better or it was just because I was enjoying the villages a bit more but there was a lot more appreciation for some of these pieces. \nOne of my biggest gripes of the original was Overpowered the glider felt, and how it limited the ground exploration that you would like to have. With the increased mobility options in the sky and the themes of this game. Those gripes were wiped away leaving my moment to moment exploring feeling a bit more enjoyable.\n\nThere's so much to go over that I feel like I have to skip more of it but something I can't ignore is the performance. 98% of my playtime was docked and the performance dipped to a, not awful but offputting performance at least every hour. In some locations (some dungeons even) performance would hold under 20fps for minutes on end, making me feel a bit nauseous (Fire and Water Temples). This has been played off as a minor inconvenience by some critics but I disagree and am not willing to forgive because the switch is a less powerful console. This could have been fixed if you were given options to remove effects or draw distance. \n\nOverall I still enjoyed the game, it's easy to recommend to people who liked it's prequel but if you were like me and found BotW to be moving in the wrong direction, you should brace yourself for a similar experience. I can't say whether you'll enjoy it more, but I did. Even if I think technically it might be a bit worse.",

Unlike the first game in the sub-series, I was not compelled to see and do everything, because much of what I saw and did felt like a repetition of what BotW was. Sure, the new powers are a technical marvel, and the story has a bit more bite than the previous one, but both have their problems. The powers are way too broken, so much so that as soon as you learn a few slightly more advanced tricks you end up cheesing most challenges. It seems to me like an instance of too much freedom without any checks to make the experience somewhat challenging. The story is both too similar to BotW's (the four shrines at the beginning, the four regional phenomena...) and incoherent with it (no spoilers, but think about where Zelda is supposed to be during the Calamity, given what we learn in this game). \n\nThat said, I don't want to make it seem like I hated playing this game. I played for more than 80 hours and mostly had a blast with it. It's just not at the level of freshness and creativity that BotW introduced in the industry. ",

And this game compounds that with a 3x the size map essentially and a much more dynamic air travel system. On top of lots of QoL improvements, this game cuts the downsides of the first one and still feels different.\n\nThe depth of the new building system I think is largely up to how much of it you want to explore. It feels like most of the heavy building is left to shrines, while you can still make cool vehicles for travelling the open-world. And the sections where you do get deep into it, you get to use really cool building tricks to solve puzzles.\n\nBut the real highlight of this game for me was the flashy, complex combat. With all the new fuse combinations for weapons giving you access to burning, freezing, blowing, sleeping, stunning, exploding in any way you want, combat feels like a sandbox. The synergies between freezing and blowing someone off a cliff, smoke bombing a horde to plant bombs in their face, bomb-shielding in the air to rain hellfire arrows (which are now so much cheaper with fusing), it all just flows together like choreography. In the end, instead of feeling like other games where you just have bigger stats or weapons, the insane amount of options for combat you have make you actually feel like a god.",

          "content": "I just finished my second playthrough of Bug Fables. Sometimes with games, especially those with a lengthy runtime somewhere around 20 hours or more, one needs to re-immerse themselves a second or third time to really appreciate them. Too much content can occasionally slip through the cracks of the subconscious mind, inevitably torn from the overall. To identify these aspects, and then to work on filling in what remains, is a crucial part of understanding what does and doesn't work.\n\nOn my initial playthrough, I complained that the visual and auditory elements of the game were somewhat paltry. That they did not compare, as is almost required to do, to its primary inspiration in Paper Mario. Yet now, I believe it's not exactly fair to view the existence of Bug Fables to be within the shadow of its inspirator. Where Paper Mario succeeds is not relevant. What is meant to be conveyed in this game, from fields both visual and audio, is different.\n\nEven now, I don't think these qualities exceed that of Paper Mario\u2014particularly The Thousand-Year Door\u2014but not only do they work on their own merit, they work wonderfully. So many different tracks to convey the mood of the usually serene, occasionally harrowing, and minimally horrific sequences that permeate the journey. Catchy and memorable, captivating and invigorating. There is much that this game has to offer those fond of what was popularized, at least for some, from Nintendo's popular franchise.\n\nYet what really makes this worth playing is the effort in developing what probably should be required for any JRPG-esque adventure game: characters. Kabbu, Leif, and Vi, the three characters at the forefront of all that arises in the land of Bugaria, impress through their own individuality and goals. No character is without merit, nor are they going to veil themselves for the sake of plot or fan service or any other fluff. They are, ironically worded, people. All that makes up what we are, only in video-game form. Some may play Bug Fables because they \"heard it was good\" or \"just want another traditional Paper Mario game again.\" Both valid as reasons, what those uninitiated may not realize is that the focus on these \"people\" make Bug Fables not only worthy, but superior to its inspirator.\n\nIf you adore Paper Mario, play this game. If you adore games that value the importance of relating to and empathizing with its cast, play this game. If you adore that feeling of dread that bubbles within, rising ever slowly as you sense the end drawing near\u2014fear that you may not have much left to spend playing\u2014play this game. Certainly not perfect, as would be expected from a smaller team of developers, yet it embodies all that makes video games great. I cannot recommend it enough.",

          "content": "A charming game that takes inspiration from the old Paper Mario games but adds enough content to be something fresh. Bug Fables follows the journey of Team Snakemouth as they search for various artifacts to help them find the Everlasting Sapling, a mythical plant that can grant a bug eternal youth. The team includes Vi, an ambitious honey bee, Kabbu, an honorable beetle, and Leif, a level-headed moth. The team travels across Bugaria, a place with many different areas for the player to explore during their quest. During turn-based combat, the player has to press the button corresponding to the one shown on the screen to attack and block enemies. Special skills can deal even more damage to enemies. The game has a combat system that is fun and satisfying. The player can equip medals, similar to the badges in Paper Mario, that will activate unique effects in combat and the overworld to allow for custom playstyles and various strategies. The game has a loveable cast of characters with in-depth personalities that make the world of Bug Fables feel alive, and the protagonists face points of deep character development throughout the story. The game also has a plethora of sidequests and collectibles, allowing for gameplay beyond the main storyline. Overall, I spent countless hours on Bug Fables and loved every moment of the game. It's one of my favorites, and I believe that fans of RPGs and indie games should try it.",

It is hard to write a story people care about and are able to influence it at the same time, otherwise, it would get boring really fast. This is not Batman: The Enemy Within's problem. The story flows, and you feel like a part of it. In this particular context, it takes a toll on the Batman universe, though: it is up to the player if Batman behaves like Batman, because your choices might reflect the opposite of his \"canon\" character.

The way of developing the psyche of the Joker to make you actually feel something for a character so overused in the media was amazing to the point that I consider this my favorite version of the Joker so far (not including the comics here). We also get to see a lot more of Bruce Wayne, which feels really refreshing. The game has the usual Telltale flaws, but if you came this far (this game is a sequel, so I assume you played the previous one) you knew what you were getting into.",

          "content": "Again, SPOILER WARNING\r\n\r\nLet's begin with the obvious: most gameplay aspects of interactive story-telling are identical in all games of the genre. Yes, this one is also mostly about slow-walking around interacting with the environment and partaking into dialogues that pretend like they're gonna change the story but usually don't, and doing thousands of irreversible quick-time events that may or may not unceremoniously kill off a character. So I will not consider any of these aspects flaws of this game in particular, so if you don't like this sort of game then you definitely won't change your mind on this one. Because of the aforementioned similarities in the genre, I can't help but base this review on why some similar games worked, and this one does not.\r\n\r\nGoing straight to the point: Man of Medan does not work because it misses the point on three key aspects this kind of game needs to be entertaining: characters, setting and story.\r\n\r\nTelltale's The Walking Dead worked because it had extremely likeable protagonists you wanted to protect throughout the apocalypse. This genre requires a captivating crew to get you invested and want to see it to the end. Unfortunately in Man of Medan none of the characters are likeable, most of them having but a dust of individual personality. Throughout the story it feels like any two characters could have swapped positions and the story would've still been the absolute same. The only character that showcased a little bit of personality was Conrad (nicely portrayed by Shawn Ashmore), but in my initial playthrough I managed to help him escape as soon as the conflict started, leaving me with the rest of the boring cast for the entire rest of the story.\r\n\r\nOn another comparison, Until Dawn worked because of its diversity of areas and how self aware it was that it is the game equivalent to a generic slasher film. Still, it knows how to make you fear the unknown and subvert your expectations despite the stereotypes, be it the man stalking you around or the force of nature leaving its marks around the lodge. Man of Medan doesn't feel the same way.\r\n\r\nThe game mostly lock you down to this military cargo ship and fills it with all sort of random jump scares that you will hardly connect to a real threat to you, quickly generation a sense of sameness. It is easy to see how cheap the horror in this game is long before you figure out that all the horrors are a result of hallucinations created by the so called Manchurian Gold, but this twist makes you understand why, and it just adds salt to the wound. You concretely understand that there was never a real threat other than the pirates you met at the start of the game, and that most of what you're seeing isn't real. In short, the goal of the game  on the second half ends up being ignore everything \"scary\" and just keep walking around until you end up outside.",

We're able to learn so much more about the world around us by allowing ourselves the opportunity to take in the scenery and examine the smaller details that comprise the \"bigger picture\"; Toem presents itself as an invitation to all of that.\r\n\r\nWithin the first few minutes of the game we're handed a camera, our companion throughout our travels, from small towns to mountain peaks, it's there to guide us; to tug at our sleeve and point at things in hope to provide us with a richer portrait of each community we pass through. Along the way we'll meet all sorts of eccentric characters; locals, tourists, or other adventurers, who might ask us for favors like searching for a suspicious man or challenging us to scavenger hunts.\r\n\r\nRarely are the puzzles too hard or the objects too difficult to find, but even if you are having trouble with a task or two, you're never required to finish all of them before you're able to move on to the next area, which is a nice way to allow the player to dictate their own sense of pacing regarding progression.\r\n\r\nThough the game IS quite short, (it took me only about 3 hours to finish, and around 6 to 100%) the charming atmosphere, soothing music, and unique presentation are more than enough to make up for it in my opinion, and it's an easy title to recommend anyone pick up in the event of a discount.\r\n\r\n8/10",

You have to carefully think of your next move as each one of the Joker's henchmen are taken out into the shadows. Of course there will be times that you will require to perform hand-to-hand combat, and I am pleased to tell you the system is very refined with windows of opportunity to evade hits and parry, it is always very satisfying when these are connected successfully. As you progress, your arsenal will grow with further tools and tricks to make your way through the grounds go smoother, including explosives, hooks, and other enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe asylum is full of secrets and collectibles, there are tidbits of information about the former and current residents of the mental sanitarium which very often are the pantheon of villains that Batman has had to encounter through the many decades of multimedia presence, sometimes they even make surprise appearances as well.\r\n\r\nPossibly the only complaint I have about the game is the obnoxious final fight against his archnemesis in which it transforms into an odd game of all brawn and almost no wit; but I digress, it is still a marvel of design well worth every penny.",

Tienes que plantar los distintos tipos de plantas, las cuales, al igual que en la vida real, tienes que podar para su bienestar, para los encargos que te van llegando, vender tanto en forma de ramos como sueltas. Iras obteniendo semillas de ellas y nuevas especies de la misma planta(de otros colores)\r\nVas poder elaborar tu propio fertilizante para poder ech\u00e1rselo a las plantas y que estas, crezcan mejor.\r\nTendr\u00e1s t\u00fa propio puesto de venta como dije antes, con el que ganas monedas para comprar nuevos utensilios de jardiner\u00eda, semillas, adornos. Para ello, tendr\u00e1s que ir a la plaza del pueblo.\r\nComo en todo jard\u00edn, tus plantas/flores tendr\u00e1n la visita de desagradables plagas, pero tranquilo, podr\u00e1s usar un peque\u00f1o fumigador que cada vez que se vac\u00ede podr\u00e1s volver a llenar f\u00e1cilmente.\r\nY como en la vida real, tambi\u00e9n pasaras por las 4 estaciones del a\u00f1o.\r\nA medida que vayas avanzando y ganando dinero, iras desbloqueando cosas, zonas. Pero eso ya lo iras descubriendo seg\u00fan avances. \r\nSi tenemos que hablar fuera de lo que es el juego, en plan dise\u00f1o, jugabilidad; hay que decir que visualmente es precioso. Dise\u00f1o ambiental, los personajes, el doblaje(en mi caso, el espa\u00f1ol), a mi parecer son detalles muy cuidados, hechos con cari\u00f1o.\r\nLa verdad, que ahora mismo, sabiendo que esta recien sacado al mercado de los videojuegos y sobre todo al mundo de la simulaci\u00f3n, no le veo contras,  y si los hay no son comparables con los pros.\r\nPero si sigo, no dejar\u00eda cosas que el resto de futuros \"jardineros/as\" puedan descubrir. \r\n",

The puzzles are very innovative indeed and a little bit challenging, but still It took me less than 3 hours to finish the game, which is not a lot. I liked Gorogoa but I find the overwhelming positive reviews a little bit too much. I always rate using comparative evaluation with regards to other similar games I've played, so I decided a 6/10 for Gorogoa, which is a good rating in my personal (strict) evaluation scale. ",

          "content": "Killer Frequency is an interactive fiction, you know: simple controls; talk to different characters in a linear adventure with decisions that will have a certain weight on the plot; duration about 4/5 hours and nice and simple graphics, in this case using cell-shading.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, and I imagine we all agree here, the important thing in this genre is the story. The premise here is what led me to buy it, you are a radio host, there is a murderer in the town and you must try to help people through the station. We will have some humor, drama in varying proportions and an occasional surprise.\r\n\r\nIn general, the game is interesting, the story is set in the eighties, it is entertaining and interesting and is very reminiscent of the slashers that we have seen so many times in the cinema, including several nods to some of these films. In fact, the game in general feels like a small ode to said genre (including its voice acting, which sometimes delights and sometimes fails to convince).\r\n\r\nAs a negative point I would say that upon completing it you keep thinking that although it is a good game, it feels partly wasted. Our decisions influence 6, 7 times, but after finishing it in every possible way I see very little diversity, and taking into account its short duration it would be interesting to have a greater variety of conversations, calls or endings.\r\n\r\nEven so, its premise is interesting and it is appreciated that it continues to try to give freshness to this genre. I have enjoyed it a lot and I think it is a recommendable game for anyone who likes this type of adventure. 7/10\r\n\r\nGreetings.",

Through her memories and thoughts you begin to understand more about what happened to her and through exploring the dilapidated building in which she revisits you uncover more about the unsettling Town of Light.\n\nThis game features some amazing and oftentimes disturbing visuals of both the three-dimensional world and the two-dimensional memories that you experience.  The mental institution is real; the Ospedale Psichiatrico di Volterra psychiatric hospital in Tuscany was in operation from 1888 to 1978 and was known for the brutal treatment of its inmates.  This real-life location and the sad history behind this institution make for the backdrop of this terrifying examination of insanity, memory, and the treatment of mental patients in the not-so-distant past.\n\nThe Town of Light is not really a game.  There is a lot of walking from place to place and completing simple tasks given to you\u2026such as find this or do this.  However, this game has a lot of world to explore and, with the beautifully rendered buildings and surrounding area, exploration is fun and stimulating.  In essence, The Town of Light is simply a visual story that you take part in as the player.\n\nThis game is bleak and unblinking and not for everyone.  Even though The Town of Light is a fictionalized version of the hospital and one inmate\u2019s tale; it still touches on some very scary and disturbing elements of a sad history.  However, the journey is one that, should you decide to take part in, explores many concepts of this subject matter and leaves you with the memory of Ren\u00e9e\u2019s tale in The Town of Light for quite some time.",

The creatures are interesting at first but quickly become repetitive. The game mechanics/innovations such as utilizing deductive reasoning in order to come to conclusions is an interesting idea but i feel that it does not fulfill its potential.  The story is well written but the NPCs themselves quickly become drab and feel less-than-human when compared to the various NPCs that populate games such as those in the Dishonest and GTA franchises. While playing i often found myself underwhelmed, bored, and utilizing a trainer and turning on \"superspeed\" simply to get to the next point of interest in a reasonable amount of time.  The city itself is repetitive and the graphics seem outdated.  I really wanted this to be great and would have been okay with it being decent but its not decent...its whatever. i am going to end up shelving it before finishing it and that's a damn shame and waste.   After Call of Cthulhu's less then spectacular release and now this, i fear the time has come to give up on Lovecraft ever directly making it to the realm of gaming in a respectable and worthwhile way.  That being said, LovecraftIAN games (Dead Space franchise comes to mind) still seem to hit the mark from time to time and but i will regardless need to start keeping my expectations in check with regards to anything having to do with cosmic horror.",

thing,\nThe gameplay consists of 2 tiny locations, each of which we move on a skateboard with the most casual but enjoyable platforming - to talk to someone or go to the store to buy something or prepare Power ups on our kitchen, playing a simple turn-based QTE game, The mechanics of skateboarding itself is also not as simple as it might seem at first, you will gradually be given mini-tasks to collect all the icons in a certain time for a record or even to perform tricks, it`s can provide a small challenge for fans of the genre,\nThe whole point here is in simple turn-based battles with your exes in the story or with your local suitors in an open location (for xp-farming), where you need to guess what type of \u201cprovocation\u201d will evoke emotions in the enemy so that you can inflict more damage on him with special attacks, there is an also an ultra-move like \u201ccall mom\u201d or aunt, and, naturally, you have 3 characteristics that affect the likelihood of success in attacks which are upgrading along with your level or automatically depending on your choices,\nand with the help of the above-mentioned \u201creplayable\u201d activities at the location, you can accumulate coins for all outfits, get the S rank everywhere, establish relationships with all the characters - this explains the price tag of the game, there is about 15 hours of \u201cplatinum\u201d content here, personally, I completed the game for free on Xbox Game Pass in 6-8 hours.\nThe animations seemed a little crooked to me, but the authors managed to make every move, every jump on a skateboard aesthetically pleasing, the overall \u201ccel-shaded\u201d visual are also not bad, so the game is simply pleasant to play, even if you are not interested in the plot about a bunch of evil, different-gender exes and finding out what you were guilty of, although sometimes there are funny lines in the dialogues, in general the battles here are more like an interactive visual novel, with good emotional voice acting by the way, and, well, a family drama about the difference between generations, a tyrant grandmother and sister`s faults is also present here , but more in the end.\nOf course, I expected a little different from the creators of the conceptually good \u201cFalcon Age\u201d (where we traveled around the world from 1st person with a falcon-pet), I can\u2019t say that the result was something outstanding, but it`s definitely something unusual, including gameplay points, \u201cOuterloop Games\u201d made another good game, it\u2019s worth a try if you\u2019re ready for experimental projects (although the developers could do without mentioning vulgarity in places, authors, come on).\n\nCheck my Annapurna Top:

I'm Asian too, so this was doubly effective. I honestly really enjoyed this game, and it's one of the better games I've played this year. ",

          "content": "The game starts you with three attributes, with one main one based on a questionaire you do at the beginning. As you level up you can put points into them and they also increase as you pick dialogue options in conversations. You also have the basic stats that go up the more you use them like attack and defense. I thought these were some decent RPG mechanics overall and I liked engaging with them.\r\n\r\nThe combat is very much like Persona where you have to target enemies weaknesses by taunting them like making them angry as an example, and then using abillties that target that weakness type for maximum damage. Also as you defeat the exes, you can do side missions for them afterwards and unlock them as summons in battle which I thought was cool. I also liked how you couldn't use certain summons in certain fights based on that exes story ties to the enemy you were fighting. Just small attention to detail that I liked.\r\n\r\nThe story was easily the best part though! What I like is that they don't present Jala as some kind of Mary Sue with no flaws, as they make it clear to you from the beginning that she has made a lot of mistakes in the past, and your choices will effect her path to redemption. I thought all of the dialogue was great and its all voiced which was surprise for a smaller game like this, but very appreciated as it makes the game easier to get invested in. The characters are all just teeming with great energy and it was blast to interact with all of them. They also do a great job of repersenting gay characters which is always nice to see in a video game in my book! The ending I also thought was very good and fitting for everything that the story was building up to.\r\n\r\nThe only part of the story I found a little disappointing was the side plot involving the towns teenagers being groomed by a cult leader. The game builds it up like your going to take this guy down, and I always love me some cult take downs in video games, but the ending to it was VERY anti-climatic. I don't know if this was based on choices I made in dialogue that lead to the ending I got, or if there even is another ending get. I couldn't really check as of the writing of this review, I couldn't find any real guides or walkthroughs to check if I did something wrong. They do bring it up again at the end of the game, so I don't know if thats sequel bait or something. I will be disappionted if it is, not that I wouldn't want another game from this team, but that I would have to play a second game to get a proper resolution.",

          "content": "SteamWorld Dig 2 is a perfect sequel to this Metroidvania series. It takes everything the first game was and improves on it while adding some neat bells and whistles to the formula all it's own.\n\nFirst of all the game is just gorgeous with this really interesting painterly art style. Big bold colors and fun shapes are used everywhere. It all perfectly sells the town of El Machino, the incredibly detailed main hub (including it's denizens) of this adventure.\n\nIt picks up where the first game ended and you're playing as Dorothy searching for Rusty, the previous main character, who vanished at the end of 1. The game breadcrumbs you story bits every now and then to keep you intrigued and wanting to further dig up this mystery. The story was kind of bare bones in the first one so I'm surprised they cared enough to expand it but I'm glad they did.\n\nDon't let the extra care to the story fool you though, the main draw here is still the core loop from the first game. That being to dig up as much ore as you can carry, haul it to the top, and sell it to kit yourself out with upgrades that will let you carry even more and mine even further. Along your descent you'll find challenge rooms that will test your ability and reward you with various treasures, upgrade stations, and a new resource: cogs.\n\nCogs are one of my favorite additions to this game that adds a lot of depth and replay value. As you naturally upgrade your gear to be more effective you'll also unlock optional mods. That's where the cogs come in. Some mods cost 1, 2, or more to activate but they're not permanent. If you find that a mod isn't useful anymore and want to spend upgrade cogs elsewhere, you can slot them out and put them in the new thing. This essentially gives you total control of your play style and the freedom to experiment. You never have to worry if a weird upgrade will ruin the experience for you, just take your cogs elsewhere.\n\nThere are some great additions to your arsenal and gear that I don't want to spoil, just know that the developers keep things fresh and the gameplay ever evolving. There's always a new upgrade to learn, a secret to find, a challenge room to conquer.\n\nThe level design is in top form too. With all the options the game gives you it kind of has to be and they don't let things go to waste. There are some levels I'm never going to be able to forget and I'd reckon you won't be able to either.\n\nAll in all SteamWorld Dig 2 is one of the best Metroidvania titles I've ever played and I urge you to try it yourself if you like the genre. I'm surprised they gave this away for free. From the goofy steampunk western setting to the gorgeous artwork and the addictive gameplay you're spoiled for choice at finding something to like here. As for me, I eagerly await SteamWorld Dig 3 but I bought the spin-off SteamWorld Heist to tide me over.",

It has vibrant art style, snappy humour, great tight controls and some innovative gameplays. \r\n\r\nPlaying through Dig 2 in particular is a pure joy as far as \"classic gaming experience\" goes in my opinion. I felt transported back to Saturday morning playing games as a kid, it's a great feel good sort of game. It also improved vastly on most of the elements of the original.\r\n\r\nOne thing that was particularly apparent is how the grind is pleasant to go through. while you have to go back to town frequently to unload your findings and inventory,the back and forth never felt a chore as you always leave with something new creating an incentive to keep on going. And i'm definitely not a fan of grind and repetitive back and forth in gaming usually.\r\n\r\nOne obvious negative was that i was surprised when i reached the end of the story. i wrapped up the main quest in just about 8hours. Sure there's still a lot of collectible to be found, but i didn;t expect it to be so short.",

To dig deeper, we need better equipment, and to upgrade that equipment, we have to mine resources.\n\nThe game\u2019s standout feature is the titular digging. Thankfully, it\u2019s more than just mindlessly drilling downward. The gameplay is carefully designed and requires planning\u2014our character has limited vision, which decreases with time spent underground. Digging down is easy, but climbing back up is more challenging. So, we have to carefully plan our routes to specific minerals and decide which rock fragments to break with our pickaxe. Some structures will collapse under our weight, some are fragile, and others remain intact. Without proper support, they can fall and create a new shaft.\n\nThis system is very intuitive, and navigating the mines feels natural. Of course, it\u2019s not all about digging\u2014various enemies await us underground, each offering unique mechanics depending on the biome. The diversity among enemies is impressive, ranging from snails to spiders to cultists. Combat flows seamlessly with the gameplay, as the tools we use to mine minerals are also used to fight enemies. This ensures that combat doesn\u2019t feel disconnected from the digging experience.\n\nThe music perfectly complements the game\u2019s biomes, building atmosphere without breaking immersion. Harmonica sounds and calm melodies give the exploration a Western vibe, creating a unique atmosphere of mystery and adventure. A few of the tracks are enjoyable even outside the context of the game.",

          "content": "RWBY: Arrowfell is basically what you think of when you think \"cheaply made licensed game\". Which is weird, considering that RT clearly put some budget into it with the cutscenes in the style of the show. WayForward, however, appears to have just slapped the game together around these cutscenes.\n\nSo, in terms of gameplay, Arrowfell could loosely be considered a Metroidvania, but it's lacking a lot of the soul of the genre. Level design is boring and doesn't really encourage exploration. You basically just go to the level on the map that the marker tells you, and then run through it until you find what you're looking for. It doesn't really feel like you are traversing an interconnected world.\n\nMovement and combat are both extremely clunky. There's not a whole lot to talk about. The only interesting parts are the boss fights, which are pretty easy once you observe their patterns for a bit. Also, the level-up mechanic is designed assuming that you will evenly spread your points across the four playable characters, but there's nothing stopping you from just dumping them all into one character. So, you can get a fully-maxed out character very early in the game, which makes most of the game a breeze.\n\nRegarding the story, it's pretty boring and really just there to tie it more to the show and get fans engaged. That being said, I do find it extremely weird that RT of all companies decided to make a story where the union leader is the bad guy, while the CEO character just gets to go free despite him also doing a bunch of bad stuff. Curious that RT would write such a story. Hmmmmmm.\n\nUsually I don't have any issues with music in games, even if the music is \"just there\" and nothing special. However, here there were certain songs that just made me burst out laughing at how poorly they fit the game. There's a lot of over-the-top lyrical songs that don't fit at all in a 2D-platformer, and it pulled me out of the game a few times.\n\nTo give some things I liked, the cutscenes were the highlight, since they were in the style of the show. The art style overall was a good way to fit the characters into the genre as well. There were also a few character moments that were good as a fan of the show.\n\nOverall Score: 4/10\n",

It's a game I've moved to my \"played\" list despite feeling like I barely started, trapped in a loop of playing the same three or four levels over and over, never winning. Oh well. Mad points for the aesthetic and what's been put together here. Massive deductions for the difficulty. ",

I think I understand why they didn't provide for a way to decrease the difficulty-as this is a labour of love and the devs clearly had a vision for the type of experience they wanted to create.

          "content": "Apartado Gr\u00e1fico: vamos con lo que primero llamo la atenci\u00f3n de este juego y lo que posiblemente es el mejor apartado de este juego, si cuphead fuera un indie con pixel art gen\u00e9rico seguro hubiera acabado como death gambit o otros juegos del estilo que pasan sin pena ni gloria. El apartado visual de este juego es una maravilla en todos los aspectos, dise\u00f1os, animaci\u00f3n, detalles, todo lo hace bien, los gr\u00e1ficos malos no son importantes y no arruinan un gameplay, y los gr\u00e1ficos buenos no te dan un juego entretenido, pero cuando un juego bueno tiene un apartado visual que es una maravilla como lo es este caso deja un gusto muy bueno, no solo porque se vea bien, si no porque este en concreto es \u00fanico, no vamos a encontrar otro juego que se vea igual, y eso aporta mucho a que se nos quede en la mente y lo recordemos. Las animaciones son suaves y din\u00e1micas, los dise\u00f1os y los ataques tambi\u00e9n, cada ataque que te lanza un jefe es perfectamente visible y esquivable, los fondos est\u00e1n muy bien hechos y cada jefe se siente \u00fanico, se nota el cari\u00f1o y trabajo puesto en esto, no es solo uno de los mejores gr\u00e1ficos en un juego indie si no uno de los mejores gr\u00e1ficos en general que seguro nunca va a envejecer. Los peque\u00f1os detalles como la est\u00e1tica en la pantalla, o el sonido de cinta antigua cuando inicias el juego hacen que realmente te creas la ambientaci\u00f3n y hacen la diferencia, las letras el dise\u00f1o de los men\u00fas y la interfaz, todo esta perfectamente encajado y nunca te saca de la atm\u00f3sfera de una animaci\u00f3n antigua. \r\n\r\nApartado Sonoro: a primeras luces parece igual de espectacular que el visual pero, realmente despu\u00e9s de escucharme todo el soundtrack porque no recordaba las canciones, pueees, solo cumple, a nivel de soundtrack creo que algunas canciones llegaron a decepcionarme, como la de la pelea contra King Dice teniendo en cuenta que La canci\u00f3n de King Dice cuando te lo encuentras en las habitaciones cuando te bloquea el paso a una zona es una de las mejores pues deja mucho que desear, siento que algunos bosses pudieron tener mejores canciones o mas identificables y no pido nada que no puedan hacer porque Floral Flury es una canci\u00f3n muy buena iconica y que te mete en el combate, no pido que lo hagan con todos los bosses pero almenos si en los mas importantes, se siente como potencial desperdiciado aveces. Pero, no es malo del todo, creo que aveces es adecuado porque aunque no te mete en el combate del todo, aporta mucho a la escena, sigue teniendo temas iconicos que puedes tararear y no molestas, y que en algunas batallas la m\u00fasica este tan en segundo plano ayuda a concentrarte ya que vas a morir muchas veces y pues puede terminar cans\u00e1ndote la canci\u00f3n si destaca mucho, aunque siento un desperdicio que no hayan hecho algo con la canci\u00f3n de King Dice, la canci\u00f3n de su combate es adecuada considerando lo largo que es, es un soundtrack adecuado para el juego pero que no es excepcional y que no se siente gen\u00e9rico solo porque este es el \u00fanico juego con esta ambientaci\u00f3n, pero bueno es justamente el soundtrack que te esperar\u00edas en un juego como este, cumple perfectamente y aunque no sea la quinta maravilla sigue siendo mejor que varios soundtracks gen\u00e9ricos que ni aportan nada al gameplay y aveces llegas a silenciar por lo repetitivo que son. En cuanto a los sfx cumplen demasiado bien, todos los efectos de sonido potencian la ambientaci\u00f3n, los sonidos de un jefe cuando lo derrotas, los sonidos de los disparos y ataques, cuando desbloqueas algo, cuando estas en el men\u00fa, son sonidos que van muy bien con el apartado visual y potencian la atm\u00f3sfera un 100% junto a el soundtrack\r\n\r\nPor lo que este juego es excepcional en el apartado visual y cumple en el sonoro pero siendo \u00fanico en los 2. \r\n\r\nGameplay: el Gameplay es muy simple y se agradece, saltar hacer dash y disparar, con estas mec\u00e1nicas bases se ira desarrollando el juego, tendremos peque\u00f1os niveles como Run n Guns, o los mausoleos, pero el principal atractivo de aqu\u00ed son los jefes, el juego va de enfrentarse a jefes, son el principal atractivo, ir hacia un jefe sin pasar por un nivel molesto o muy largo, para que esto funcione cada jefe tiene que ser \u00fanico, retante y entretenido, y as\u00ed es como son.  Cada jefe tiene una apariencia y combate \u00fanico, no hay un boss que sea un clon de otro a nivel del combate, todos son \u00fanicos, hay unos mejores que otros pero es normal, pero en t\u00e9rminos generales no hay ning\u00fan boss que sea malo, todos tiene su dificultad bien balanceada, para que no te los pases a la primera ni a la tercera, pero para que tampoco est\u00e9s muriendo contra el mismo jefe 500 veces, con este perfecto balance y jugabilidad simple cuphead logra que el boss rush como mec\u00e1nica principal funcione, que nos interese ver cual sera el siguiente boss, que cada boss nos represente un reto y sintamos satisfacci\u00f3n cuando lo derrotamos. Y aunque sea simple hay variedad, tenemos distintos tipos de disparos, y amuletos, cada disparo es diferente y no es que vamos a desbloquear un disparo mejor y el primero queda inutilizable, en algunos bosses volv\u00ed  a usar el disparo b\u00e1sico aun cuando ya tenia los otros, y es porque todos est\u00e1n balanceados, y nos pueden servir mas o menos dependiendo del boss, por lo que no solo tenemos que perfeccionar nuestra habilidad si no encontrar la forma mas c\u00f3moda de poder vencer un boss, la forma mas c\u00f3moda para nosotros. Y hablando de comodidad, los controles, no lo son, si juegas en teclado, intente configurarlos y no no encontr\u00e9 forma de hacerlos c\u00f3modos, tal vez si hubiera estado otro rato encontraba una forma de hacerlo c\u00f3modo, pero vamos que se nota que este juego esta hecho para jugarlo con mando, es lo adecuado y jugar con teclado no termina siendo una tortura solo por costumbre, pero si no estas acostumbrado a jugar juegos retantes y tampoco estas acostumbrado a jugar con teclado, pues no vas a pasar de la primera zona. Con un Gameplay simple pero eficaz Cuphead es una muy buena experiencia, no es el gameplay mas original pero si uno muy efectivo dando mucho juego y posibilidades para cada boss\r\n\r\nDise\u00f1o: la forma en que esta puesto todo hace que este juego funcione y sea tan entretenido, vamos primero con los combates en si \r\n\r\nTenemos unas cartas que se van rellenando con nuestros ataques, estas sirven para hacer un ataque especial (que depende del disparo) o un ataque super que hacemos cuando llenamos todos los espacios de las cartas (ataques que desbloqueamos en los mausoleos, que son 3) tambi\u00e9n tenemos la posibilidad de hacer parrys (desv\u00edos o cancelar un ataque del enemigo) sobre objetos rosas, y tenemos una cantidad de 3 vidas osea que en 3 golpes se acaba el combate, todo esto puesto en la misma mesa hace que los combates contra jefes ganen mucho, en primer lugar tenemos la decisi\u00f3n de si ir lanzando especiales o esperar para llenar el super, y dependiendo del jefe o de nuestro modo de jugar puede irnos mejor unos o otros, luego est\u00e1n los parrys, los cuales al hacerlos sobre un ataque nos recargan una carta completa, por lo que aveces podemos arriesgarnos para hacer un parry ya que estos nos recompensan, que los parrys sean sobre objetos rosas es algo tambi\u00e9n bueno ya que nunca sera ambiguo cuando podemos hacer un parry y cuando no y har\u00e1 que Mono ver color rosa neurona activarse, y el que solo tengamos 3 vidas es lo correcto, si tuvi\u00e9ramos una barra de vida seria algo mas ambiguo cuanto podemos resistir, porque aveces en otros juegos vamos con toda la vida al m\u00e1ximo y un jefe nos baja la mitad de un solo golpe pero resulta que despu\u00e9s nos pega con un ataque diferente y solo nos baja un cuarto, esta bien para esos juegos, pero para un juego donde solo paliaremos contra jefes, que te hagan x da\u00f1o dependiendo de como se levante esa ma\u00f1ana el boss, son cosas que a la larga puede resultar frustrante o aburrido, por eso solo tener 3 vidas y que cualquier ataque nos baje solo 1 es lo adecuado, as\u00ed podremos manejarnos mejor, tener mas tensi\u00f3n cuando estamos a una vida, y dar aun mas juego intentando que no nos golpeen para llegar con 3 vidas a la fase que nos cuesta y as\u00ed poder recibir mas golpes y no recibir un golpe que nos baje toda la barra de salud. Y hablando de fases, otra cosa buena de estos combates es que no hay barra de vida en los bosses, osea no sabemos si esta apunto de morir o no  evitando que nos confiemos o desesperemos, el progreso de cada boss lo vemos en sus fases, todos los bosses tienen distintas fases donde cambia el combate, empiezan a hacer ataques distintos y cambia un poco el combate, dando as\u00ed mas variedad a cada boss evitando que sea esquivar los mismos 3 ataques de mierda  durante 40 minutos donde la \u00fanica dificultad esta en que el jefe es un tanque de HP que no se muere con nada a no ser que tengas equipado un mont\u00f3n de mierdas que nunca te explican como se usan o para que sirven (ya te vi genshin impact), tambi\u00e9n el que este dividido por fases hace que sintamos progreso en cada combate, porque podemos aprendernos todos los ataques de la primera fase y pas\u00e1rnoslas a la sexta vez sin que nos golpees, siendo as\u00ed los bosses como mini niveles donde iremos aprendi\u00e9ndonos sus patrones e iremos pasando cada fase muriendo y aprendiendo en cada una, y como cereza sobre el pastel tenemos que cuando morimos nos muestran que tan lejos llegamos en el combate, lo cual hace que cuando vemos que est\u00e1bamos a casi nada de derrotar al jefe digamos, \u201caaa juego asqueroso\u201d, o que digamos que esta ves estuvimos muy cerca y nos motivemos mas  seguir intentando. \r\n\r\nEso con los combates que hay de el resto, pues el juego no es un selector de bosses, tampoco es ir recorriendo zonas donde cada zona hay un boss \u00fanico ambientado solo para este, hay 4 zonas en el juego donde est\u00e1n los bosses, el mapa termina siendo casi un selector de niveles que en vez de ser un men\u00fa es una mini isla, lo cual le da sentido a el juego ya que b\u00e1sicamente estamos yendo a matar deudores para darle sus almas al diablo as\u00ed que es como irrumpir en la casa de alguien para matarlo y llevarle sus pertenencias al due\u00f1o del casino en el que apostaste todo, cada pelea contra boss esta puesta como un elemento del escenario que destaca por lo que no se sienten puestas fuera de lugar y el mapa no se siente como un selector de niveles disfrazado, ademas que de buenas a primeras el mapa estar\u00e1 bloqueado por alguna zonas, y para desbloquearlas tendremos que matar a los bosses, en dificultad f\u00e1cil o normal, la dificultad f\u00e1cil solo nos abre el paso pero no nos da el contrato del alma del jefe que necesitaremos para avanzar a la siguiente zona, por lo que vencerlos en f\u00e1cil sirve para explorar toda una zona o ir a un nivel Run N Gun que necesitas para ganar monedas, y hablando de monedas y Run N Guns, los disparos y los distintos amuletos los compramos en una tienda, las monedas para comprarlos las encontramos escondidas por el mapa (lo cual lo sabemos porque en la primera zona hay un npc que te dice que no conf\u00eda en los bancos y dejo todo su dinero por ah\u00ed y una moneda esta puesta en un lugar que de seguro la encuentras por lo que sabr\u00e1s que hay otras escondidas) o haciendo los niveles Run N Guns que nos dan unas cuantas monedas, si queremos comprar un disparo que creemos que nos va a ayudar contra un boss que nos cuesta, podemos derrotarlo en f\u00e1cil e ir a el nivel Run N Gun para desbloquear monedas y comprar el disparo, as\u00ed que el modo f\u00e1cil en los bosses no est\u00e1n tan de adornos. En cuanto a los mausoleos son 3 y solo sirven para desbloquear los ataques super, por lo que pasan sin pena ni gloria y una ves hecho no se pueden repetir.\r\n\r\nYa habiendo hablado todo lo anterior queda hablar de los puntos en los que noto que el dise\u00f1o falla, el primero es que unos NPC te dicen algo \u00fatil para darte una moneda y los otros solo sueltan palabras al azar, y no es muy entretenido ir hablando con todos porque carisma no tienen y solo est\u00e1n de fondo, se agradece pero bueno,  que un tipo me de el reto de hacer 3 parrys  seguidos para darme una moneda y otra me diga que consiga un atajo para decirle y que me de otra moneda esta bien, pero que ambos est\u00e9n en la misma zona y que en la zona siguiente no haya un npc que me diga algo de valor pues esta un poco flojo y se pudo solucionar haciendo que simplemente uno de esos 2 npc este en la otra zona, no se porque a una zona le ponen contenido interesante y secretos y la otra la dejan vac\u00eda haciendo que efectivamente esa en concreto parezca un selector de niveles disfrazado, es solo un detalle menor que no se nota a la hora de jugar pero que se pudo hacer mejor para dar mas sustancia a la tercera zona y no concentrar parte del contenido en la segunda siendo que en esta segunda zona encontramos 3 de las 5 monedas secretas que hay por el mapa. Y otro problema que si se nota a mi parecer, es el pobre balanceo de los amuletos, todos los disparos est\u00e1n bien balanceados y sirven para algo, no hay ninguno que sea remarcablemente mejor que otro en todas las situaciones, pero los amuletos son otro cuento, 2 son una mierda, 3 son decentes y 1 es realmente \u00fatil y casi indispensable, el cual es la bomba de humo, que remplaza el dash convencional por un teletransporte, este amuleto nos salvara de incontables golpes y har\u00e1 que algunas peleas sean mucho mas sencillas, y en ciertas peleas note que hab\u00eda ataques que de no ser por ese amuleto eran casi imposibles de esquivar, esto podr\u00eda pasarlo por alto de no ser porque estos amuletos se compran en la tienda, jugando puedes perder un mont\u00f3n de tiempo y dinero probando y comprando amuletos que no te sirven para nada, ademas la bomba de humo es uno de los primeros amuletos que te pod\u00edas comprar, por lo que la intenci\u00f3n no era ir usando amuletos decentes hasta llegar a la bomba de humo y ahora si sentir una progresi\u00f3n, la intenci\u00f3n era que al igual que con los disparos puedas elegir el que mas se adecue a ti sin dejar una diferencia abismal en lo \u00fatil que pod\u00edan ser, perd\u00ed algo de tiempo probando amuletos que muy \u00fatiles no eran, almenos el de los dash autom\u00e1ticos sirve para la pelea contra King Dice, los que te dan vida extra a cambio de que hace menos da\u00f1os son insufribles, el que te permite hacer parry a los bosses pues sirve si quieres no se pasarte el juego sin disparar, y el que va recargando pasivamente las cartas no es tan \u00fatil ya que con el del parry autom\u00e1tico seguro hasta lo recargas mas r\u00e1pido, pueden servir a la larga si ya te aprendes los patrones de los jefes y no se quieres ir spameando especiales o te cuesta hacer los parrys para sacar calificaci\u00f3n perfecta, pero teniendo en cuenta lo mucho que la bomba de humo facilita algunos bosses pues te resulta mejor aprender a hacer parrys que aprender a esquivar ataques casi inesquibables si no tienes la bomba de humo, Al final esto es un detalle menor donde solo perdieras unos minutos pero teniendo en cuenta que los disparos est\u00e1n bien balanceados me da la impresi\u00f3n de que esto lo dejaron as\u00ed porque quisieron y porque la bomba de humo estaba algo rota como para ser el dash convencional.

          "content": "A game from creators of Bastion. Oh, what expectations I've had for this one. Obviously had the preorder with the soundtrack going and played it day one. And what a strange experience it was. I like most aspects of the game, and yet I wasn't inclined to play it at all next time, so I finished it only now (2-3 months later?) by forcing myself to do it which is pretty sad, because the main story is actually VERY short. Without much of side \"challenges\" (which are decently designed but most of the time force you to play with predesigned powers (\"functions\") installed and it was pretty unfun for me, because I like to design my own tactic in this game) the game takes around 3 hours to finish. With getting \"some\" challenges done it goes up to 4-5 hours. Nevertheless, I don't think this gamelength is really acceptable, so that's a sure \"con\" for me. Now some pros and some more cons.\n\nPros:\n-The music. It's very good, wouldn't expect otherwise from Darren Korb. While the game was sitting idle in my library, the soundtrack I have purchased got it's share of plays in the last months. Just like in the Bastion. One thing I would say it feels a bit lacking of electronic elements, which would be suitable in this setting. \n-The art is impeccable, with great love to detail. Just like in Bastion.\n-The setting. Very strange, interesting, kind of unique. Just like in the Bastion.\n-The \"functions\"-system. Robust and full of variations, makes for good replayability and interesting levelups.\nFor some cons:\n-The story. Very basic, not trying to hook you in at all. Mostly it goes by like \"whatever, I am here somewhere, go on now\". There's not much happening at all, the synopsis of the story would take approximatly 1 page after it's all done. I mean, I don't belong to the type of players, who cna't play a game, which is weak on story, but I require at least good gameplay to have interest in it.\n-The game-play. Repetitive, gimmicky and boring overall. The \"planning thing\" is gimmicky, overpowered and breaks the flow. The regular mode makes you feel seriously underpowered and is a bit of a cluster-fuck. After I've found the \"right\" functions combination, all of the fights where just a grind. In combination with the first flaw - it is why it felt like I don't want to go on (I just couldn't figure it out in the first hour yet).\n-The sword. He is so whiny and emo it makes me want to smack him and tell him to grow a pair. While he is the 80% of the means how the story and setting is conveyed to player, in the end I just wished he would shut up -_-\n\nOverall, you might want to check it out at your own risk, but this is no Bastion.",

          "content": "Terraria appears to be quite a simplistic game at first. I would assume the majority of players first played Minecraft to some extent and figured they'd try what appeared to be a sidescrolling version of that game.\r\n\r\nWhile everything seems straight forward for the first hour or so, it wasn't long before i realised just how much depth there is with this game. There's a lot to it, much more than i had anticipated. Worlds within worlds, lots of different environments, enemies, weapon types, spells, armor and items to keep you entertained and occupied. I usually don't like to compare games when reviewing them but i think many will draw a comparison to this and Minecraft, and personally i find this to be much more combat and adventure focused rather than the sandbox/building focus that lies with the latter. For me personally, that's a good thing. There are a dozen or so bosses and they all pose different challenges and can be fought in different ways. The world itself feels very alive and as so much of the game is random different playthroughs on different worlds can provide many hours of entertainment.\r\n\r\nThere aren't too many major flaws with the game itself. Controls can be a bit awkward (on PS3 at least) and there is the occasional bit of slowdown and lag, but nothing too severe. My only real problem with Terraria is the negative aspect of the huge amount of depth within the game. I find myself having to use the wiki or a guide most of the time i play, as every hour or so you find yourself with a bag full of items that can be pretty confusing as you're never really sure what to do with it all. You have to build houses for NPCs and storage space for the many items that you'll need on your travels. Bosses normally require summoning along with an 'arena' of some kind and specific items/equipment to get through, all of which takes time and can be incredibly awkward. The challenge of each boss is good, but the sheer amount of preparation beforehand detracts from the experience somewhat. I find myself spending a lot of time micro-managing items and manipulating the land itself just so i can do x y and z before finally doing what i originally set out to do. While playing i sometimes just wish everything was a little bit more straight-forward.",

Terraria sets itself apart by having a stable game engine that doesn't die if a ton of mods are added, good optimization, and better ways to interact with the world.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this to anyone. It's a fun introduction to games, but it does have a bit of a learning curve (might wanna keep the fandom wiki open while ya play).",

          "content": "Tried Last Stop simply based on the trailer once it came available on GamePass, i thought it looked vaguely quirky and mysterious. And it was in the end, the odd characters and underlying story were definitely the high points. But while i was hoping for some weird x-file/Twin Peaks vibe.. it never got to that level. \n\nOverall it felt like Last Stop had unrealised potential, the story unfolds in an interesting manner (3 side stories played in chapter successions) but then the story itself just.. falls flat? Honestly, i'm not even sure how i could sum up the story itself after finishing it (maybe there are multiple endings?). The final chapter came about very abruptly, out of the blue and did not explain or resolve anything much.\nThroughout the story there's a couple random gameplay features that feel a bit out of place. QTE while running, a random FPS investigation chapter, a body scan?! but.. why? they don't add anything, and most of the time feel clunky. \n\nThere's a lot of dialogue choices here, but it never felt like they had any decisions tied to them. I think they open different dialogue trees, but i first expected branching paths or events (like a TellTale game).\n\nHaving lived in London for many years a while back, gotta say the setting definitely gave me a smile and brought some personal nostalgia. Which is a very big plus :D Anything from the pub, to the row houses, or the chippy felt pretty delightful. \n\nAll in all, while i enjoyed it somewhat i can't say it's worth a big detour. But if you're into story driven dialogue type games it's a fairly quick play and is entertaining enough. Just lacks in depth. ",

LA jugabilidad y control del personaje es c\u00f3modo pero se puede sentir tosco a veces por las animaciones, adem\u00e1s que las armas que nos da el juego no son algo variado para desenvolver nuestro propio estilo, solo son un chiste malo y 2 armas que atacan exactamente igual pero con un ataque especial diferente, la primera espada solo la usaremos para vaciar el ataque especial en un jefe o enemigo fuerte y despu\u00e9s la volveremos a guardar es un total desperdicio los ataques no son casi nada diferentes.  \r\n\r\nDise\u00f1o: el mapa esta bien implementado pero a veces es ambiguo a donde ir o volver. hay decisiones extra\u00f1as como poner el dash aereo en una zona abierta al final donde casi no se ve y solo nos lo dan para utilizarlo una vez para avanzar al final, una habilidad que pudo dar mucho juego y movilidad para que no se sienta tan tosco, ni siquiera hubiera hecho mas f\u00e1cil las batallas porque todas est\u00e1n bien hechas y una ventaja de movilidad solo har\u00eda que sean mas justas en ratos donde no podemos casi ni esquivar. Una vez pasas las zonas no hay tantos incentivos para hacer backtracking no hay cosas que recuerdes como ooo ahora que tengo esto puedo volver a esa zona, ya que la mayor\u00eda de obst\u00e1culos son una puerta o una plataforma alta que no nos da inter\u00e9s y parecer\u00eda que llegar\u00edamos desde otro lado, lo cual terminaba siendo cierto en ocasiones, pero en las ocasiones en las que ten\u00edamos que volver, de no ser que te pases todo el juego en un d\u00eda, se te va a olvidar y terminaras dando vueltas por todo el mapa. \r\n\r\nDificultad: es ajustada, a veces mas dif\u00edcil a veces mas f\u00e1cil, mientras mas avanzas mas f\u00e1cil se hace y su soluci\u00f3n es ponerte salas repletas de enemigos dif\u00edciles o un jefe overleveleado, para lo que tendr\u00e1s que ponerte a farmear para subir de nivel.\r\n\r\nGraficos: son incomodos aveces, las animaciones se sienten toscas y el estilo poco trabajado, pero como en momodora, el dise\u00f1o de los personajes es muy bueno cada uno tiene sus caracteristicas que hace que los diferencies y te parezcan bonitos, pero esto solo para los jefes y personajes principales, los enemigos tienen un dise\u00f1o mediocre parecen clones todos con la misma cabeza o un dise\u00f1o plano y aburrido que no se beneficia de los graficos.\r\n\r\nSoundtrack: decente no hay ningun tema memorable ni nada solo cumple su funcion bien pero nada que destacar \r\n\r\nHistoria: lo mejor, tiene un giro interesante, los personajes son genuinamente queribles y el final es muy bueno, las interacciones entre los personajes construyen bien la relacion entre estos sin necesidad de cuadros inacabables de texto, los fragmentos de texto que nos cuentan la historia no son textos inacabables de lore y lore si no que son concretos por lo que es facil enterarte de todo y si no te paras a leer, di\u00e1logos puntuales te insin\u00faan el lore y todo. una mejora muy buena en comparaci\u00f3n a momodora que es llegar y matarse a co\u00f1azos con monstruos y pegarle en las tetas a una bruja sin contexto alguno, aqu\u00ed desde el principio tienes interacciones lore y objetivo \r\n\r\na pesar de todo lo bueno que menciono, esas caracter\u00edsticas buenas tampoco son peak, son normales, es un juego simple y disfrutable puedes conectar con la historia pero las zonas y los enemigos no dan para mucho lo mas interesante esta en los jefes y la historia ",

          "content": "Pretty good. Bought this forever ago when I was going through my \"I love horror and only horror\" phase. I had never, ever finished it before because I kept getting stuck on some of the puzzles. I realise now I also was just panicking too much about being caught which is why I just kept struggling to complete certain puzzles for years on end. I was literally not letting my brain work XD Now that I've actually managed to play and complete it, it's time for a proper review.\n\nI really enjoyed Outlast. The storyline is simple enough with just enough of a mysterious twist to it that keeps you thinking and wondering until pretty much the end of the game. Speaking of, that ending? WHAT?! I absolutely did not see it coming at all which also helped with how much I enjoyed the game. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a game where you can easily work out what is going to happen but it is still more fun playing games where you can't guess the ending. There wasn't a huge amount of character development which I was okay with since they focussed more on the story development. There's an appropriate amount of collectibles and it's nice that they glow as well so you can see where they are (at least in the mode I played it in).  The first person aspect worked very well in this game and I enjoyed the way in which they incorporated the video camera. Especially later on in the game where it then begins to feel like you're playing more of a \"found footage\" horror game because of the involvement of the camera.\n\nWas I still screaming and jumping at every little jumpscare? Yes! But did I still enjoy the game as a whole? Definitely! Would recommend for anyone looking for a solid horror game with jumpscares, puzzles, and an unpredictable ending.",

The premise of the game was not appealing to me, but I gave it a try. I stuck around just to see the ending. See, if you are that hyped for something, it rarely delivers. And this was so true with this game. While the game-play part was better than I expected, and catching Bugsnax/interviewing/finishing quests was fun, the hype over the story and the twists was way too big for it to deliver. My only reaction after finishing the game was asking if this was really it, and I could not understand why everyone raved about it. The game as a package is fine, mostly suitable for children, and is okay to spend a weekend on. Nothing more, nothing less.",

          "content": "Including Lara Croft in a game which heavily relies on Egyptian mythology is an interesting and very appropriate choice. The game is fun but can get a tiny bit repetitive as in it's set up that you do this tomb, then the next, and the next, etc. I know that's the point but also the action is also pretty much the same from tomb to tomb. In some you can die from fire, in some from spikes in the ground, and in others from ice cold air coming out from the ground. Avoid these to complete the objective of each tomb, all while being attacked by a variety of very easy to kill enemies in order to bring back Osiris and you'll have to play it yourself to see why Osiris has to come back. Occasionally, some of the enemies were harder to defeat but it was also a little confusing trying to work out exactly what you had to do to defeat some of them, particularly when closer to the end of the game. As always, I found myself constantly forgetting to change weapons which could have maybe made my playthrough even easier if I had remembered. Also, some of the collectibles seemed almost borderline impossible to collect (though this may have been another skill issue of mine). Definitely would say some of the achievements on Steam are also pretty difficult to get, for me at least. The number and variety of weapons was pretty good, and I enjoyed the fact you could also customise which outfit Lara was wearing as well, though more options would have been great as well.",

The story was really well done with entertaining dialogue and likeable characters. It also treated some important topics, such as end of life care and autism, with a lot of sensitivity intelligence. The only drawbacks I had for this game were the controls being a little clunky, some repetitive puzzles at the end of sections (although they dont take long and there arent that many) and at first I really hated the art style which looks very bland and to make it worse most of the game happens in memory sequences where a filter washes out the little colour it had to start with, though I got kinda used to it by the end and it didnt spoil a really moving story.  All in all its just a fantastic moving story, of the quality you don't often see in games.",

Also the ending, though I found it to be too uplifting at first, is just the right amount of sweet-bittersweet when you think about it. However the writing is spotty and a bit inconsistent, while the game's \"game\" nature is still in question in my mind. The small bits of interactivity are clearly shoe-horned in and the game only takes advantage of exploratory storytelling in a couple of instances. The fact that they're making it into an animated film says a lot, though I'll still be looking forward to it since this should've been an animated film to begin with IMO. Overall the lack of interactivity and the clear option of a different medium to better convey its story took away from my experience with it, but it's worth playing nonetheless; a great story presented as a decent experience that falls just short of the story's high standard.",

Perhaps the only one that competes with it are the titles of Sam Barlow, which in part is still a story interwoven. To the moon as a book would not work, as a series would be somewhat bland but as a video game that does not use many playable resources works like a shot. It is a tender and very nice story. It may not be a game that everyone can enjoy because it is still a narrative game and nothing more than that but that along with the great soundtrack that makes it a beastly experience and one of the best stories and narratives that have ever had video games.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\nEmotive and Deep Narrative: 'To the Moon' stands out for its moving story and emotional themes, exploring love, loss and regret in a unique way.\r\nCreative Puzzle Integration: The connection between narrative and puzzles is exceptional, revealing deeper layers of the protagonist's life as challenges are solved.\r\nNostalgic Visual Design: The retro visual style creates a nostalgic and melancholic atmosphere, perfectly complementing the emotional tone of the story.\r\nImpactful Soundtrack: The soundtrack, along with the sound effects, contributes significantly to the experience, enhancing the emotions and key moments of the game.\r\nAccessible Gameplay: Intuitive gameplay and clear feedback facilitate immersion, making the game accessible to different types of players.\r\n\r\nWorst:\r\nLow Replayability: The game's lack of branching options and linearity could affect its replayability. The inclusion of elements that encourage a second experience could improve this aspect.\r\nRelatively Short Length: While the short length may be beneficial to some, some players may wish for a longer experience. The inclusion of additional content could satisfy those seeking a longer experience.",

          "content": "Story 9/10\r\nThe concept of the game is interesting, it manages to tell a very emotional story based on memory, it knows how to be comical and dramatic when it should be. It also touches on very identifiable issues: that either one can interfere in the life of another person or the meaning of happiness, who would like to fulfill their dreams before dying, even if they were false? Very few games tell a romantic story.\r\nThere is also no direct exposition, one is watching the story through the scenes and without redundant dialogues.\r\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\r\nEach and every one of the characters, not very complex but they are very human, with defined personality and very identifiable and queribles.\r\n\r\nNarrative 5/10\r\nThe work would gain more by being a movie or an animation. The game uses a lot of in-game animations taking control of the character, plus a lot of dialogue. What's more, gameplay and story are completely separate, unlike Half-Life or Outlast.\r\n\r\nGamePlay 4/10\r\nThe gameplay is very limited, there are not many mechanics and it is often repetitive, so it is good to last only 4 to 5 hours.\r\n\r\nGraphics 7/10\r\nThe game shows us a very good detailed Pixel-art, with realistic and beautiful backgrounds. It also gets a great atmosphere for the drama, but it usually goes a little bit, especially in comic scenes, where the sad tone of the game does not clear a bit. The design of characters is decent, besides the animations, although good, there is not much expression on their part for the scenes.\r\n\r\nMusic 9/10\r\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, many songs based on piano, that are perfect in the game and its emotional story. However it is not perfect, in the realm of how it is used, because there are comical moments where these songs sound and a little off.\r\n\r\nFinal Score 7.1 / 10\r\nIf they are people who look for fun and playability, it is not recommended, instead if they are looking for a good, emotional and identifiable story, yes.",

Its strong point is definitely the art style and environments, but that is not to say that the gameplay is not good. They have developed enough fighting mechanics and enemies that get gradually introduced into the game, so you don't get tired of it, despite its relatively simple nature. It is unpolished and exploitable at times, but overall enjoyable. The story is interesting, and although it suffers from exposition, this serves the tongue-in-cheek character of the game. It makes some annoying mistakes, like drawing the last two boss fights for way too long compared to the rest of them, but I still recommend it if you watch the trailer and are interested in it.

It's a very interesting concept to make a game using this mechanic where you have to make noise with your cane to \"see\" the room you're in or contact somebody via your phone to explain to you what you're looking at. I did get jump scared sometimes, especially when the \"entity\" or whatever they refer to it as just randomly breathes in your ear. I understood the storyline as far as you being in this house to work out what happened in your life however I was occasionally confused by the different people being mentioned in the different sections of the game. I'm still not super sure who some of the mentioned names are or the relevance to the storyline. I honestly didn't expect the ending, I also didn't expect the game to have been based on a true story. I was a little confused about the obsession with the tree but turns out it's usually just an indicator that you've reached the end of that chapter. The end chapter was probably the section where I was wondering what the heck was going on but overall, still a good storyline despite the odd plot hole. Character development of the main character was okay and I like that there are 2 modes you can play it in depending on how much voice lines you want to hear. Puzzles weren't too difficult either.",

To be honest there where some scenes I was happy for the low-fi graphics, cause they would probably be a bit too much otherwise.

          "content": "Cris Tales is turn based RPG immediately set apart by its utterly gorgeous art style, and intriguing use of split screen, differentiating between three timelines; past on the left, future on the right, and of course, present in the center. It's the sort of game that makes a striking impression even from a screenshot. Disappointingly, the game built around this immaculate presentation just doesn't hold up under the same microscope.\n\nFor starters, there's the performance issues, especially on the Switch, which is where I happened to play it. Load screens are something you'll become intimately acquainted with in Cris Tales, and each of these loading screens last around 20 seconds on average. (It's also worth noting that a loading screen accompanies each and every random encounter)\n\nIn addition, there's also just a startling lack of polish to the game all around. The opening hours in particular are incredibly poorly balanced, and between the lack of money and the inability to heal until reaching level 5, even the most common enemies can prove to be a challenge. The balancing does improve considerably once you acquire your healing skills, but even then, you'll still encounter a huge spike in difficulty at random every 4-5 hours or so. (Hope you didn't forget to save often!)\n\nThere's also a few other minor inconveniences, like the way town names aren't listed on the world map, or that the tent item, which I think is intended to be fairly common, is WILDLY overpriced up until near the end of the game.\n\nSetting all this aside, Cris Tales just isn't very interesting; the story and combat system both feel largely uninspired and derivative, and even the time manipulation elements are rarely used or even beneficial during combat. It's a real shame. It really is stunning to look at, but even the gorgeous aesthetic isn't enough to prop it up from its myriad of issues as a game.\n\n5/10.",

And it would actually be a very 'feel good' kinda game.. if it weren't for the sadistic platforming :D\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, those controls are buttery smooth and it plays fantastic, but some of the platforming gets insanely hard to the point you have to redo the same screen 50 times in a row, and some of those being the main path not simply the optional chests. The other main issue is that those sections are pretty much impossible in co-op (yet alone with 4 players i imagine!), so you end up with your buddy floating in the air trying to stay out of your way while you desperately try to make it through a screen.

It only takes a quick game or two to get the hang of what's going on, and Hidden in Plain Sight is a great pick up and play game, with a few mini games to choose from.\n\nIn my favourite mini game, you're placed into an arena with identical characters (one for each human player and lots more AI-controlled - a number that is customisable). First, you have to figure out which character you're controlling. Then you have to gain points by pinging a totem without the other human players figuring out who you are, hunting you down and punching you (one-hit kills).\n\nDeath Race is also fantastic. Again, each human player has to figure out who they control (characters do look different in this one) without giving away they're a human player to the other human players. Each human player has one gunshot to use on a player they suspect might be human. First to the finish line or last standing wins.\n\nThere are other fun mini-games and a couple we don't enjoy so much, but for ",

The aesthetic is great and I genuinely was scared by enemies. I felt really intruiged by the games premise and story telling and desperately wanted to unpick what was going on. But there is a fatal flaw that frustrated me to the point I had to uninstall it. The only way to save is with the gold coins you find around the castle. Theyre pretty limited and you also need them to unlock items in the game. This meant that I had to save them up to progress but in doing so I would have to go long stretches without saving and mutliple times I died and lost a huge chunk of progress, forcing me to replay the same sections I had just beaten. This ruined the entire experience. I cannot reccomend this game at all since the save system completely. undermined everything I enjoyed so much. At this point I'll probably just watch a playthrough to see the rest of the game rather than waste any more time replaying parts I already did.",

This is literally climbing simulator that want to surpass Assasins Creed XD. I realized that I am playing this kind of walking simulator type, if you are root for your character at least you want to finish the game as fast as possible and without even bother collecting left item that just small plot revealing. The great aspect from this game are graphic and the beautiful scenery of 3D world that is not half-baked but lack of animation in character (who do the same acts in every chapter), the music makes myself yawning several times with chill-piano for 3 minutes and then gameplays becomes quiet until finishing each 8 chapter.\nSo my final verdict is 7.",

          "content": "TL,DR Review\n\nHelp save Bulb Boy's family from a dark corruption and survive hostel entities along the way. A point-and-click game on the shorter side, what's here is good but consider playing on a touch interface.\n\nFull Review\n\nUnder a quiet night at the Bulbhouse, Bulb Boy and his family enjoy an evening of television. After Grandpa Bulb's falls asleep on the couch and his teeth somehow ends up in the fishbowl, Bulb Boy and his flying Bulb Dog head to bed. While Bulb Boy has a nightmare, a dark force enters and corrupts Grandpa Bulb and transforms the whole Bulbhouse with horrific results. Take control of Bulb Boy to save his family and survive what awaits.\n\nBulb Boy is a point-and-click experience that takes you from one set piece to another, there's no huge area or map exploration here and there's little chance of getting lost or wandering aimlessly. Pacing is varied with a mix of horror &amp; lighthearted moments that help to keep the game from feeling too similar to something like Fran Bow.\n\nThe environmental puzzles have a good amount of challenge without feeling too obtuse but know that some are time-sensitive so try not to idle for too long. There's a nice amount of creativity to the world of Bulb Boy from environmental changes to enemy types so it never ends up feeling stale.\n\nMouse control works well enough, although you get the impression at times that Bulb Boy was targeted for touch controls on a smaller screen.\n\nThis game is on the shorter side with around 90 minutes to 2 hours to get through and even with some optional achievements to acquire, there isn't much reason to revisit. Even so, I did enjoy the game for what it was and I have no criticisms outside of it's runtime. Bulb Boy is worth playing if what's here appeals to you but consider it at a reasonable sale price.",

The passion of so many people to indulge in the hustle and bustle of city traffic with the tin can has always seemed rather irrational to me, but in a country where a car isn't simply a 'car' but a 'Volkswagen', I'm more of an alien as a bicycle rider.\nBe that as it may - because of the enthusiasm for 'Re-Volt' and 'Trackmania', I didn't flinch for long - and the authors have really watched 'Speed' a few too many times. The game is crazy hectic, but the idea to develop such an ironic game concept out of the so often horrible driving physics of arcade racers, this is kind of charming. Only, in contrast to the virtual trip to the N\u00fcrburgring, I find that parking on the screen doesn't bring more joy than in a German city center. Respawn every 20 seconds, mines and heating rods at every corner, standstill is death - a game flow can't arise. If you still like it, please do.\nWe learn early on that features are still being worked on diligently. I might have shown mercy in Early Access, but if this is the release, I simply can't recommend it.",

The visuals and atmosphere still holds up, but this is bogged down by finicky combat mechanics and stealth that suffers from similar complaints as the Assassin's Creeds of the time - fighting with the environment. I found the exploration and puzzles to be more enjoyable than the main storyline, but the further the game advanced, the more I wanted it to be over. There is also a plethora of gadgets that end up cluttering the directional buttons in a confusing amalgam. It is not always clear when to use what, destroying any sense of intuition. The waypoint system is also tiresome, with the way to progress not being obvious. I'm a fan of exploration, but with such vertical span allowed to the player character it is easy to lose yourself. ",

By implemented simple changes, such as, changing the way their economy work by implementing a auction house instead of a open market with every item and currency being tradable like it is at the moment. This would stop the bot and increase the in-game item value. I understand that this probably is hard to do since the top players are all in with these cheats, but making this change will show the community that Gamigo group is willing to change and take their name out of the dirt like it is at the moment.",

It's almost difficult to digest in that way, but it does a great job at putting you in the shoes of your character by connecting with him.\r\n\r\nGameplay wise, well it's a walking simulator so to speak, there's isn't a lot of gameplay mechanic beyond orienting yourself and selecting dialog trees via your radio (which is great!). Early on in the game i decided to turn off the map markers, which i'm very glad i did! turns what would be a minimal gameplay mechanic is a pure treasure of orienting yourself in the wild, just with a map and a compas, i had a lot of fun of just figuring out where to go solely based on radio instructions alone, highly recommended!\r\n\r\nThe visuals may not be realistic but this very much acts like a tourism post card for Wyoming, and i would argue that the graphic style would help making the game a long lasting gem many years from now still.

The story and the artwork are amazing in this short game and, when added with the music, made for a memorable experience.\n\nThe game encourages you to explore while learning more about the two stories that intersect on several different levels.  Uncovering artifacts, easily noticeable in the game, ensures that the story progresses.  The achievements are mostly easy to get and, for the most part, are part of the story.  Getting all the achievements will require a bit of work but worth it in the end.  Light puzzle solving and interesting platforming completes the game.\n\nI found The First Tree to be enjoyable, heart touching, and mesmerizing as I explored both tales within a beautifully created world.  I recommend this game for those that like good stories, exploration, and beautiful artwork. ",

          "content": "beautiful game, decent concept, mediocre execution.  Please be warned, that this IS a \"walking sim\" with some puzzle elements and not an RPG or true \"fox sim\" (in that one is merely running and jumping, not hunting, eating, drinking, or surviving).  This game could have been something like a terrestrial Abzu but falls VERY short of that magnificent work of art.  The game is basically a walking-sim with seemingly unrelated (to the gameplay) dialogue between a couple who have recently experienced great loss as the male narrator describes different aspects of his difficult growing-up and overall life. This game would be good (its not bad, but it certainly isn't good) if the level design better matched the gameplay intention of the developer in that i imagine the game is supposed to be relatively easy and relaxing but instead can be very tedious and frustrating due to poor level design and lackluster controls.

This is a different game, it shouldn`t copy the approach of the original, but at the same time it retained the features of the source, the world here consists of 3 large locations, in each of which a small plot scene awaits us, the choice of which location to go first and which one to go to second and third - depends on you,\nfor me, \"Zero Mile\" is a full-fledged original product, a continuation at the level of the original, with not so much replay value, but with its own \"completely different\" atmosphere, the sunny life of the minister's daughter next to the dictator's palace, and the game has a powerful competent ending, which is very lacking in the orig. Road 96,\nPeople also complain that the decisions don\u2019t really affect on something? C`mon, it was the same in the original, I believe that it`s enough for decisions in games to create the illusion of choice, it`s impossible to write several high-quality scenarios in 1 game, one but exciting is better, after all, the games are a scripted attractions for a couple of hours. At the same time, M0 has its own new choice system, where you must balance between 2 points of view in order to be able to make any decision in the final, there are 4 endings, by the way.\n\nI already see that I`ll be in the minority, I thought a lot about lowering the rating, but I can\u2019t, my conscience just won\u2019t allow me, I dived into an unreal atmosphere, laughed at cool dialogues, got into the story and ending based on the friendship of 2 characters, while all the characters in the game are made very interesting, Dixiart has some talent for this, this is the first story game in..how many.. 2 years, probably? people, what's wrong with you, even AAA is now coming out with a disregard for it, story-driven games simply don`t exis, they have died out,\nand here is a completed competent story, yes, I didn\u2019t really like the roller/skate`s sections, but there are few of it, they serve more as a background mini-game, the concept is correct, it was made for emotional release, and in order not to have to draw too complicated cutscenes, but they could be better, for this you can really take away 0.5-1 points, but the 2nd rhythm game, about running away from Adam, is very funny, it\u2019s a pity, the rest of the \"races\" are not like that.\nYou will also find a couple of new cool tracks here, you will find soul-warming references to the original, Mile 0 just \"made my day\", it will definitely become my contender for the best game of the year, despite the disappointments of some fans and gameplay-minded critics.\n\n\ud83d\ude0aSubscribe on my Steam`s

          "content": "A fantastic exploration/narrative adventure - you play a scientist following the trail of her old mentor, who stumbles upon alien life in the oceans of an alien world. As you explore, you catalogue species, follow the trail of your mentor, and unravel a mystery in the depths of the alien ocean. You navigate through a map/radar system, and primarily interact with the game through a series of tools you have in your dive suit. Although the game is non-violent, it does have a resource management side, where you use gathered specimens to not only study, but fuel your oxygen and power cells in your suit. Past that, the game is largely story driven. \n\nAnd what a story! This game was thrilling in my mind - an excellent encapsulation of the mysterious and wonderous genre of science fiction. The style and music were also hypnotic, making the game a treat to interact with. A few small nagging annoyances exist - backtracking occurs, which in of itself is not always an issue, but in this case can be onerous due to the lack of mini-map when you are diving, making obtaining those precious specimens tedious at times, as you try and find your way to areas you missed on your first pass, without a map HUD. Sure, markers you haven't been to are coloured differently than those already tread, but that doesn't help when you backtrack. This was a minor annoyance, but certainly detracted from my overall enjoyment. \n\nPast that small complaint, and amazing adventure awaits in this title, and should be of interest to those who enjoy smaller, narrative adventures, science focused exploration, and a chill but engaging ocean going experience.

It seems that the game was crafted as a world-first before the story. I so much wish that authors followed one of the very known guidelines when making the story - starting writing it from the end going towards the beginning. This way you've felt that the perfectly crafted world will not be enough for the whole story. It has a love triangle and it's pretty messed up, yet the best possible ending somehow doesn't feel like the best. It's worth experiencing, but I'm not sure if playing it is the best option here.",

The '90s street style aesthetic is spot on and adds to the experience, despite disabling the VHS graphics filter towards the end. The city is \"static\", with NPCs in certain spots telling you part of the story or giving you hints on where to look next. I usually dislike non-linearity in my games, but right here everything just clicked together without being told what to do next or where to go specifically.\nIf you like platformers, you should give this a go, although you won't miss a lot by not playing it.",

          "content": "Jugu\u00e9 cuando lo pusieron gratis temporalmente en Steam. La verdad es un gran juego, es muy divertido y desafiante. Al estar hecho para el cooperativo, jugarlo con amigos es genial. Adem\u00e1s, conseguir el trabajo en equipo, no es complicado. De hecho, es un juego con una jugabilidad sencilla pero que puede complicarse realmente r\u00e1pido.\nUna de las mejores cosas que tiene es que es muy rejugable, cada nivel se genera proceduralmente (y cuentan con seeds como en Minecraft, por si te gusta alguna) y hay bastantes mejoras y estilos de juego que explorar. Desbloquearlo todo llevar\u00e1 bastante, depende de la habilidad de los jugadores.\nEn aspectos t\u00e9cnicos, es un juego de bajos requisitos que a\u00fan as\u00ed se ve bonito (por la iluminaci\u00f3n) y elegante en cierta manera. Por otra parte la m\u00fasica es buena, agradable, motivadora y pega mucho con el juego. Aparte cambia dependiendo del bioma y tiempo (noche, d\u00eda) en el que te encuentres.\nLo que queda son detallitos, como los originales men\u00fas que tiene, las skins desbloqueables, el modo libre (que empiezas con el tren que quieras), etc. Tambi\u00e9n, es un juego muy estable, no he encontrado bugs hasta el momento y tampoco ha habido problemas con los servidores. Lo \u00fanico que creo que le falta es un modo que no sea Infinito, uno por niveles convencionales, que tengas que llegar a X metros con alg\u00fan requisito para conseguir 3 estrellas y pasar al siguiente nivel.\n\nSinceramente, lo recomiendo mucho. Sin ninguna duda me lo comprar\u00e9, porque durante este tiempo que he podido jugarlo gratuitamente me ha convencido y (en parte) enamorado. Pocos juegos me han dado este entretenimiento con amigos.",

You can choose the order of the planets to explore and easily travel between them, but since there aren't many side quests there is usually no point of returning once the main quest part is done. Side quests, while few, blend in with a main story very well. \nEnvironments are gorgeous, every planet has it's distinct look and feel - from endless deserts of Tatooine to forests of Kashyyyk.\nCharacters are likeable, the story is interesting, combat, though simple, but enjoyable. Character progression is very satisfying.\n\nOverall it's a great game and probably one the the best rpg's of all time.\n",

I appreciate the effort in its action and gunplay but be prepared for the enemies to have better aim and pop-off shots rather quickly. It is challenging but not prohibitively so, and once you practice/play more, it should become far easier to progress. The violence and gore are also fabulous.\n\nThe story and transfer between maps/locations could have used some extra time in terms of being quality components of the game. They didn't help make the game flow well or seem pieced together in a meaningful or sensible way.\n\nEnemies are too overzealous in their attempts to find you in that there isn't any strategy to their AI decisions: they hear you - they come toward you. That's it. It's that simple. It leads to them bulking up and then rushing and overwhelming you. \n\nIt's not that I don't like 12 is Better Than 6; I simply don't think it does well in accomplishing its objectives in terms of game design during development. It's too repetitive and the story is too fragmented.",

          "content": "You take the job of the town fisherman of a small island village and begin your work around the islands nearby. The job seems normal enough, but odd things begin to happen, especially at night.   Strange mists, rocks that appear out of nowhere, ghost ships, and even sea monsters appear out of the dark...and that\u2019s not even counting the strange people you meet along the way.  An odd local man known only as \u2018The Collector\u2019 seems to be icing on the crazy cake, but as you gather strange items for the man things get even weirder and either your sanity or the fate of the world might just hang in the balance.\n\nDredge is a third-person fishing inventory management game with a generous helping of Lovecraftian horror thrown in for good measure.  Here you explore and fish the waters around a group of unique islands that hold many dark and disturbing secrets.  You will fight against time, inventory space, and panic as you explore around completing tasks for the mysterious Collector.  While doing these tasks you will want to take advantage of fishing spots so that you can sell the fish you catch to upgrade your boat with items like brighter lights, better nets, and more versatile fishing rods.  These upgrades are important and will be needed to complete other tasks and progress the game.\n\nDredge operates on a day-night cycle where the act of moving or fishing causes the time to move forward.  While it is usually fine to be out and about in the daytime, the true horrors habitually emerge at night. You must be careful as your sanity meter will drop when it is dark causing situations that can damage your ship or even sink it completely.  Resting at one of the docks in the game can help bring your sanity back down to normal where you can once again face the open water in relative peace.  \n\nThe game currently has one DLC, The Pale Reach, which is not needed to complete the game but adds a stand-alone story, more items to find, more fish to catch, and more achievements to the base game.\n\nAchievements are relatively easy but may take some time to complete.  Some of the achievements are tied to the story so they are hard to miss but other achievements range from completing all the tasks given to you to finding every type of fish in the game.  Additionally, Dredge offers two alternate endings, each with their own achievement, and both are easy to get.  In all, the achievements for this game are attainable with effort but still enjoyable without feeling like a herculean task.\n\nDredge was easy to learn right off the bat, and it was quite enjoyable to explore the sights, get immersed in the story, and spend some time fishing.  The game is a mix of a cozy and Lovecraftian horror and I enjoyed my time fishing the horrifying waves and dredging up strange secrets.  Additionally, the art style and music had their own charm and appeal that helped make this short game quite memorable.  I recommend grabbing Dredge and fishing up strange and mysterious things from the terrifying depths yourself.",

As for the characters, there are a lot of them and most often they are just reskins, for example, Wolverine generally has the face of John Jameson) I would prefer that there were 30 characters in the game, but that all of them should be unique, but I must admit that here there are enough interesting special heroes, but as a percentage of the total number of figures available in the game, this, of course, units. I also should note that the game is incredibly buggy, the characters are constantly getting stuck somewhere, so even technically the conveyor of lego games is not perfect, on new systems the game also crashes very often.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/",

So, let's go point by point, the authors came up with a very entertaining concept of the \"Fashion Police\" in itself, running after dull-dressed citizens, and helping them adjust their taste preferences in the right direction, with the help of paint and sewing guns. Despite the uniformity of tasks, such as \"go and clean up the area\", the game has a general plot, it is, of course, as \"thrashy\" and simple as possible, but its very presence in this genre already adds a few points to the game from me personally, and at least a couple of times, the game will make you smile. There is no lgbt+ agenda in story, it iss only in our most \"fashionable\" main character and a maximum of a couple of little things. Well, now about the most important thing, why in the gameplay of the game everything did not work out so well, the fact is that 6-10 hours of play can be both an incredible buzz for you and a \"burning ass\" mixed with a buzz, as it turned out for me personally, so I would advise you to play in general on easy difficulty, because, unfortunately, a small team of 3-4 people in their first game, alas, could not build the correct game design of the arenas, this is my main Complaint, which made me lower my final grade a bit, as much as I don't want it, Look, here we need a certain weapon to damage a certain enemy, at first you will have 2 guns, each has a main and an alternative fire, you will need to shoot at someone with the left button, at someone with the right, if you shoot the \"wrong\" cartridge, there will be no damage to the enemy at all, excluding 2 weapons, which already have nuances, but it given closer to the middle-end of the game, visually - this is, for example, dyeing the clothes of an office clerk or hemming a citizen in hanging clothes, And it's awesome! Such a system gives the gameplay a bit of \"strategy\", doesn`t allow you to walk with one weapon the whole game.. here, by the way, there are endless ammo,\ndifferent types of enemies spawn on the arena and the difficulty is to have time to switch to the right gun, BUT the locations themselves are not at all adapted to this,\nmost often these are very narrow rooms, where you can't even run in circles, sometimes the enemy spawns out in front of your face,even having prepared in advance, you are unlikely to dodge damage,\nHow, devs? In such a dynamic and \"multi-layered\" gameplay you lock the player in these fucking 1-meter boxes, some \"mouse fuss\" \"on luck\" turns out, you maded open street lanes at the beginning of the game, there were also squares, but most of the battles in the whole game takes place in small rooms, where 10 different bots spawn from all sides at the same time,\na banal increase in the size of the battle arenas would already partially solve the problem, there is also an enemy releasing a gas cloud in a huge area in front of him, it is very problematic to run away from several of these with 5 more enemies in the room,\nor, for example, \"electric scooters\" rushing at you at an incredible speed, well, devs, make somewhere an opportunity to jump from them up to some small \"tower\", like on a beach location where you can climb on the cabins,\nalso defeated enemies do not completely disappear from the map and create additional inconvenience,\noh yes, we also have a local hook-cat here - a belt, on which we can fly up, but the \"multistoried\" gameplay in vertical space is practically not used here, a maximum of 2 \"floors\", and even they are quite rare,\nyes, by the way, this is again a mechanic from Doom Eternal, which everyone uses now, but in the same \"Shadow Warrior 3\" and \"Postal: Brain Damaged\" the hook is used quite competently,\nbut here the Belt is also needed for small \"parkour\" sections, in general, the game has a lot of gameplay abstracted from the basics, which dilutes the standard formula well: Parkour sections with 2 types of platforming, 2 exciting sniper mini-games, 1 chase with a machine gun, mini-games between boss stages, these are the things I wanted even more than the main gameplay,\nThe bosses, by the way, are well balanced, they are moderately interesting, not hardcore, there will be checkpoints between the stages, I was pleased with the gameplay of the second boss, where you had to look for a suitable weapon while the boss was \"stunned\", And visually pleased with the third one, which throwing magic needles and scissors at you, and the first one is quite standard, like 3 side missions, by the way, which looks somehow \"template\" and \"forced\",\nThere is also an \"UltA\" - Style Glove, but you cannot \"take\" it with you to the next level, and it always accumulates at the scheduled moment of the level, at which the developers will spawn 15 bots at 1 point and you can hardly resist using a super attack for a couple of opponents at the end of the level, but there is also a little plot sense in using it.\n\nI also want to separately praise the developers for the \"water gun\", shoot with a left button, then aim with the right button and have a strong pressure for alternative fire - this is perfect, it's perfect to shoot from it,\nyou can also spray \"accelerating\" water on the floor, which opens up the functionality for parkour and gives off strong vibes of the \"Portal\". And also thanks for the Russian. subtitles :)\nIn general, it turned out to be a good entertaining FPS, somewhat average, as, for example, in music, although it is quite \"full of life\" and fulfills its function, and the locations lack diversity (only city/beach/yacht), in some ways game awesome - in visuals, in concept and in some gameplay decisions, but also with a bunch of game design mistakes. I don\u2019t particularly want to scold, but it's a pity that it didn't turn out better than it is, but the game will still definitely entered my top 2022, and I will wait for the 2nd FPS.\n\nSubscribe on my Steam Curators page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41977550/\n/\n\u0412\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f
