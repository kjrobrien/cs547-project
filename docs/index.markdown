# Abstract

NextGame enhances gaming discovery by recommending games based on user preferences. Users select several games as a starting point and NextGame then 
offers game recommendations for the user to try out. NextGame uses the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#getting-started) to retrieve information and reviews about all Nintendo Switch games. 
Then, NextGame uses three methods for generating recommendations: item-based collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and an LLM-based recommender.
